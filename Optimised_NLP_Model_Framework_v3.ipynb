So no pump.  \\nRight now, I'm doing one stick in the morning and winging it the rest of the day.  The newer insulin regimen has helped my A1C, but I'm far from perfect.  I think my last one was 8.5.\\n\\nI've found that I absolutely need a CGM and we're looking at what's out there.  Dexcom seems to be the most recommended, but I'd like something like a wearable watch that doesn't need supplies to keep it running. \\n\\nI'm really behind the times and I'm getting better information from this sub than I get from my doctor (not an endocrinologist).\",\n          \"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top Comment Reply 5\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Discussion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 909,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"strange libre 2 graph i have only used libre for about 1.5 years but in this time i have never had a graph like the one attached. this sensor is only a few days old but in those days it has been similar graphs. is the sensor faulty? or is it possible for that much variability to be natural?\\n\\ntwo contributing factors could be 1. i am experiencing pain in that arm at the moment - not related to the sensor insertion. 2. the attached graph is from a fast from about 7am-7pm so can\\u2019t see food being a factor. im no expert but all i look for in these graphs is that during fasting it stays within range do you have a finger-prick monitor to confirm?\\n\\nnot an expert, but i would have thought it would not be normal, otherwise it would mean that someone doing an finger-prick reading would not really have much idea of what their blood sugar really was.\\n\\nsmall variations are normal, but for me the only time i can remember have seen changes by over 3 mmol/l in a 15 minute period have been either after eating, taking insulin, exercising. getting stressed or the false alarms due to a compression low.\\n\\nas far as i know the reason for the 1 hour warm-up time is that abbott knows that puncturing your skin to insert the sensor filament causes trauma which can result in unreliable figures, so it is possible that whatever is causing the pain in your arm could be affecting the readings. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

medtronic sensor and should wakeup call them just little backstory wa diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump wa the last one anima made and wa compatible with the dexcom think sensor loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensor were year later medtronic acquired anima and discontinued the pump and wa forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for year recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issue encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive wa garbage would regularly have sensor fall off after couple day dexcom can still properly stuck there for week the medtronic accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm need recalibrating constantly the very least every hour which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wake you dexcom calibration necessary it amazing this specific for but dexcom sensor are covered health care and the medtronic one where costing arm and leg the result all this wa that control wa significantly affected when wa the medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partner sleep and effected our relationship all all wa serious step backwards from where wa just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two system when wa moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concern when wa trying sell their new system what gathered wa that their closed loop system us the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirement and same terrible accuracy the old one can recommend anything would trying get looping using dexcom sensor and omnipods running off your phone it liberating best luck team hope the roller coaster not too extreme for you guy today edit wa the pump and the guardian sensor apparently the new one pretty good upgrade compared the older one that being said wa also looking article that echoed some same point above dono look the same and seems have the same problem someone read this who the fence dexcom just dont have major complaint about them theyre reliable accurate and convenient wa part the trial for the first medtronic sensor and remember hating them because wa still having test three time day although wa kid and wa trial there that now have the tslim with and can pretty confidently say the the only reason wa able get diabetes controlled state hate finger prick and struggled with depression anxiety without probably still have thats something people dont talk talk about how much help your mental health knowing you can trust what your sensor telling you wild glad hear youre the tslim those look
