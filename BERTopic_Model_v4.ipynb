wanted  jump  here  compare them\\nthe dexcom system  fantastic better  every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made  control worse the main issues  encountered with the medtronic system were\\n the medtronic cgm adhesive was garbage \\u2014  would regularly have sensors fall off after  couple days dexcom can still  properly stuck  there for weeks\\n the medtronic accuracy was awful \\u2014 consistently    mmoll  mgdl off and would get worse through the life  the sensor dexcom  consistently bang  accurate after over  week\\n the medtronic cgm needs recalibrating constantly  the very least every  hours which  super annoying  you calibrated  the middle  the day forget  recalibrate before you   bed and  wakes you  dexcom  calibration necessary its amazing\\n this  specific for  but dexcom sensors are covered   health care and the medtronic ones where costing   arm and  leg\\nthe result  all  this was that  control was significantly affected when  was  the medtronic pump sensors falling off would often leave  for long periods where  had  sensor and fell back  fingersticks the poor accuracy meant  was hesitant  trust the reading from the cgm  make adjustments  worse take the wrong dose dependant  the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and  partners sleep and effected our relationship all  all  was  serious
