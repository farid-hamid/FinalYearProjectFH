based the database actual outcome not the math what should happen the paper go talk about what might causing all the variation tend think that the average glucose number more important than the gmi

app this app used perfect until about two month ago don always receive alert when high low when open the app have wait second for the most date reading show not sure how this delay started because this used instant this preventing alert from going off when needed last night wa high for hour and the alert rang after about hour didn change setting anything anyone else having this issue maybe phone using iphone pro max probably your phone daughter wa also taking forever show her number she just updated from the the and more issue agree with that assessment have not sure how demanding the dexcom app actually the phone since mine got pretty powerful bionic chip make sense that older phone model would have more trouble running app like that thats always running the background all the time matter what\",\"yes but not too low treated waited and again alarmed felt better did fingerstick which revealed dexcom however insisted wa still low due put new sensor tomorrow evening and wondering wouldnt hurt change day early calibrate mine ha always been pretty quick respond the inputted\",\"doe the dexcom app really require android considering that the dexcom app fairly simple app android feel like artificial requirement medical device have through strict testing process also reduces their liability\",\"dexcom people can relate buzz buzz buzzbeeeep beeeep beeeep\",\"overpatch for libre ive been using the dexcom and ha been great problem month insurance now making move the libre concerned that overpatch come with the sensor the one that come with the dexcom solid patch that really hold the sensor place ive been amazed how well the patch stick look like going have purchase patch from amazon somewhere else what patch that similar the dexcom patch that will really hold for two week with daily shower thanks for your advice skingrip shower daily\",\"libre dexcom where live dexcom libre app upgrade two option cgms insurance pay portion ive trialed month ago for tried chose libre decider ive following dexcom subreddits failed sensor adhesive failing seems common having tried one sensor life ive found stick fine prefer smaller size libre canada android phone help thanks for wa two thing that made the freestle better the first wa size dexcom very bulky and the filament wa lot longer found the painful and cumbersome wear the second wa the alarm use the reader for the freestyle which allows put all alarm vibrate only andor turn them off the dexcom ha urgent low that you can not turn off which mean you get even after treating due the delay the sensor lastly personally found dexcom le accurate but noticed the freestyle also had issue when used the app maybe app thing\",\"reading inaccuracy just started using dexcom middle september many issue one really bother certain point day sugar jump jump for instance afternoon went bunch time minute lunch when got home work checked meter said recalibrated day cgm sensor saying arrow dont know stress constantly worrying cgm inaccurate doe anyone else experience number jumping one minute next next scan way sugar rising fast feel like the more precise and accurate look like they dropped the smoothing feature the help adapt there predictive value better blood sugar doe bounce around feel the only reason people expect smooth because the software made look that way\",\"looking for thought those who have used both the dexcom and the freestyle libre sick and tired lost signal and erratic reading dexcom well somewhat over half sensor last the entire day cycle people would limit discussion trouble praise for one device the other love hear from those with firsthand experience having used both system hoping hear only from people have switched from with system the other please thank you never used the libre only the freedom libre libre use the dexcom now used use the dexcon until may have had great luck with dexcom sensor lasting the entire day the only one had trouble with are the two that used the required overpatches since quit using the overpatches ive not had any come off run outside every day from mile day occasionally run ultramarathons mile ride bike trainer inside least time week when that sweat profussely still issue thing differently than most though mount the sensor pectoral muscle prep that area differently too first you cant shower for least hour before applying the sensor hors after people tell you shower before applying just walk away they can not help you not all smh then prep the area shave using isopropyl alcohol shave cream shave all direction then apply isopropyl alcohol with exfoliating pad glove after that air dry open the box and then apply the sensor then press into for min second but usually after that take pair curved hemostat press the adhesive strip ainto skin look for lighter colored area that indicates le adhesion around the edge and stroke outn from the inside the outer edge seems like lot work but really easy try and let know what you think good luck which ever system you chose great review freestyle for never lasted the entire time therefore fell off early always make sure hair free area and clean area only with percent rubbing alcohol agree problem with and only second\",\"that whole worry about going low had that one time wa horrible\",\"tandemdexcom what dont you like ive posted couple time about medtronic pump cracking and well latest month old replacement ha cracked this shocked face really considering switching tandemdexcom because tired dealing with low quality pump that fall apart additionally seeing others talk here and after taking with endo think tandem and dexcom sound like better quality device ifwhen talk tandem rep going get all the detail about why their pump and sensor are great would like hear from user about thing you dont like not because want talked out changing but because want into this with realistic expectation and know what dealing with also wa wondering about whether charging the pump pain theory all for rechargeable battery but the idea being tied outlet unappealing least with medtronic pump know never far away from somewhere can buy battery someone who can give one how you deal with charging note aware insurance not covering new pump while current one warranty and know tandem ha program get around have very very few negative about the tslimdexcom combo but the one have are sort nitpicky the clipcase absolute junk tried type tacticalemd case that everyone seems love and found them too bulky for personally wish someone would make spring clip can use put pocket like did with pager back the day before cell phone ended with clip from amazon slapped the back pump which work best for there brightness setting perfectly fine during the day but when wake the middle the night and check rather have option not burn retina out charging personally find annoying plug during meeting work while showering while the couch watching but think rather able replace battery that being said also reasonably sure had replace the battery complaining about the cost don think there good way about this what like about the omnipod can charge overnight like phone but the tubing the tslim sort make that really bad idea one thing want add and can follow direction that your tandem rep probably won say that tandem customer service unbelievable every time called been great this from someone who

sensor giving many problem yes know get replacement suck knowing trust sensor wanted vent haha same row either fell off were horribly wrong and take insulin amount based what sugar before eat before anyone come and say always check with what the the point dexcom\",\"and it hard bring one back with that high delta usually pullreplace and get new one from dexcom\",\"woken alarm that sugar wa too low and cant even turn off that alarm first time using cgm this third day using hypoglycemia night blood sugar dip low five minute going back healthy range feel fine asleep anyway the apps alarm earbleedingly loud wake partner cant turn damn alarm sugar mark alarm turned understand safety feature please option least lower volume alarm set\",\"dexcom reading fluctuation first week with the dexcom and wondering normal that number can fluctuate that frequently within the minute update for example this morning woke value and within the next minute wa and rising found that really big jump did check against meter and showed honestly just surprised that the number can shift and down that quickly actually just logged here ask the same question this second day dexcom first time using the had switch after incident where inserted and kept bleeding like crazy anyways what noticed wa whenever take shower show reading that doesn make sense for example wa telling that with two arrow thought should correct but now telling and trending low like how that possible any insight would greatly appreciated please hot water cause false high you give minute after you shower and are out the cooler air should drop back normal know what you mean graph all over the place honestly feel like number were better before putting this lol\",\"dexcom correct nice job\",\"cgm which better dex libre until jump through hoop get insurance cover will paying out pocket price wise the libre better but have read they arent accurate and you cant calibrated been using the dex free for month provided through benefit work and love having cgm they both have advantage and disadvantage pricing better the libre also last longer smaller the dexcom more accurate ha much better third party app support can exported apple health ha much better native software can calibrated you are correct that libres can calibrated although haven honestly had much need calibrate the libre other than one two sensor being off little more than the allowance personally having used both would dexcom all day pricing wasn object\",\"yup saw comment recently similar post that said because covid now thought vascular virus basically mess with your blood some degree hence why people with severe covid have blood clot stroke heart issue etc can affect your dexcom reading even though dexcom doesn read blood blood play big role interstitial fluid which dexcom doe read advice would stock strip and supply for your meter until thing sort themselves out and stay super hydrated got good stock strip\",\"ive read abput people gwtting reading there watch which would make life much easier work for but cant for the life figure out how avput setting some people recommend using gluroo some say glimp say they had cod link themselves tried gluroo and that failed spectacularly and with glimp every time tried scan the cgm said invalid serial number can anyone here give fairly direct answer the easiest way about setting have link step step setup they can refer really appreciate the help\",\"dexcom should taken off fda approval device list the ha very poor sensor that need completely redesigned every day have had call their tech support line and complain about this all they say they are sorry and will send another piece garbage recent highlight about how dexcom handle this since will need replacement sensor today because took all the sensor shipped they dont answer the phone have been waiting for minute while the wait time minute have also been told have exceeded the limit replacement sensor they need get supervisor approval strongly encourage anyone considering get the abbott freestyle libre haven had any problem with not single sensor ha failed fallen off love the accurate reading get the ability calibrate fine tune the small size the minute warmup the hour grace period the ability overlap sensor the improved app all around great device hear you and concur strangly enough had problem with the either have say started with freestyle device and hated wa truly awful switched and haven had any issue all love\",\"people experience dexcom one after year stable blood sugar ozempic hbac now rising previously used dexcom when used insulin and found more reliable than the freestyle libre looking into using one again and now have much wider choice doe anyone have experience using the dexcom one the and what your preference and why ive been unlucky enough use the dexcom one and the libre all using android phone the dexcom one the moment which current prescription could choose then would for the but only because the app offer the ataglance feature phone lock screen the dexcom one app doesnt have this have unlock phone and open the dexcom app see the dexcom once doesnt have app that run pixel watch either term application comfort and accuracy have not noticed any difference the smaller with lower profile than the one which the same size and shape the being able calibrate the dexcoms against finger prick seems make more accurate than the libre that need calibrating and after it been calibrated dexcoms are complete pain you get sensor that need calibrating have never personally had issue with the adhesive it always stayed and never caused irritation regardless which device use thanks used them when they first came out the calibration issue including for sensor are burnt into psyche pixel and using fitbit doubt will work the fitbit may try the dexcom one and get round buying pixel watch consider the then ill self funding and hope this will avoid having back insulin but have feeling that may forlorn hope\",\"dexcom app and io update dexcom iphone user you update io even when not officially tested compatible dexcom find dexcom are always far behind testing the latest io wa io and hadn updated age the most current io update wa never the dexcom compatible list here australia\",\"heat and moisture humidity interfere with the accuracy cgm sensor it likely not true reading happening the shower\",\"le accurate dexcom wa but meter said and the second dexcom came down picked again and wa cgms will naturally around minute behind your meter due how read the interstitial fluid instead blood here good video from dexcom explaining this that make sense thats why accuracy check andor calibration important when your most stable mine the morning when wake and before breakfast the next morning after installing the new sensor ive done check two later during the day but now basically verifying calibration feel low low\",\"very low importance dexcom overpatches where could get funny out the norm over patche\",\"dexcom freestyle libre been using the with tandem pump but now can pick between that the and the had the old libre long time ago and liked okay except that one you had scan the reader over any thought the new libre versus the not pump user mdi but started the libre for month and now second could choose lean towards the libre found it smaller profile more comfortable for bluetooth range better and every minute reading nice plus the day life the like the calibration feature the and the overall app and data provides better than the libre app both are accurate after day for far think both are fine choice but the smaller profile and extra day make the libre the winner for think thank you appreciate the input\",\"freestyle libre read somewhere that starting january that abbott coming out with this doe anyone know anything about this wa told tandem rep that the libre would integrated with the tslim early and that only pump user will upgrade the libre will continue available for others have heard that the libre will work for day but haven seen heard anything official that the rep also told libre integration with tandem will follow later don know that mean there will need libre not\",\"new dexcom sensor issue just started using dexcom sensor the past month made the switch from the freestyle libre because getting pump soon the tandem that work with dexcom had thing down science with the libre and wa never going low rarely going high and wa hitting percent range more day than not the past ish week with dexcom have had very bad low the lag dexcom\",\"phone alert question okay high number get repeat alarm every minute even though set high alarm per hour anyone know wrong thanks\",\"cgms anthembcbs switch from libre dexcom ive been thinking about this for sometime now have anthem bcbs and currently pay month for sensor for the libre dexcom seems the superior product although libre seems interesting with ketone monitoring well and finally true cgm opposed scanning but thats awhile out for those you with anthem any you have dexcom what your cost have the dex also might way for the but think ready switch it stupid have scan thanks for any information can tell you that you are medicaid you will blocked from buying any cgm out pocket pharmacy will not sell you one regardless

that first pump wa the last one anima made and wa compatible with the dexcom think sensor loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensor were year later medtronic acquired anima and discontinued the pump and wa forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for year recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issue encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive wa garbage would regularly have sensor fall off after couple day dexcom can still properly stuck there for week the medtronic accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm need recalibrating constantly the very least every hour which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wake you dexcom calibration necessary it amazing this specific for but dexcom sensor are covered health care and the medtronic one where costing arm and leg the result all this wa that control wa significantly affected when wa the medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partner sleep and effected our relationship all all wa serious step backwards from where wa just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two system when wa moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concern when wa trying sell their new system what gathered wa that their closed loop system us the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirement and same terrible
