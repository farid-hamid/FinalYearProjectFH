sensors are much better than the medtronic sensors and should wakeup call them just little backstory was diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump was the last one animas made and was compatible with the dexcom think sensors loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensors were years later medtronic acquired animas and discontinued the pump and was forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for years recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issues encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive was garbage would regularly have sensors fall off after couple days dexcom can still properly stuck there for weeks the medtronic accuracy was awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm needs recalibrating constantly the very least every hours which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wakes you dexcom calibration necessary its amazing this specific for but dexcom sensors are covered health care and the medtronic ones where costing arm and leg the result all this was that control was significantly affected when was the medtronic pump sensors falling off would often leave for long periods where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant was hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustments worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partners sleep and effected our relationship all all was serious step backwards from where was just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two systems when was moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concerns when was trying sell their new system what gathered was that their closed loop system uses the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirements and same terrible accuracy the old one can recommend anything would trying get looping using dexcom sensors and omnipods running off your phone its liberating best luck team hope the roller coasters not too extreme for you guys

error report site get any feedback from them ill post here\",\"consistently very inaccurate cgm readings higher blood sugar levels ive been using cgms for few years now and ive noticed over the years that blood sugar over mmoll mgdl then the readings get significantly higher than what the finger pricks show this hasnt just been occasional faulty sensors but ive observed this same behavior most not all sensor ive used over years for example right now sensor showing mgdl while from the finger was mgdl and wasnt changing had been flatlining for hours last sensor had instance where was showing mgdl the sensor but was mgdl from finger another annoying thing related this the sensor tends correct itself accurate reading around mgdl which shows instant drop like mgdl this then triggers start predicting low and triggering alarms since dropped quickly know the margin error supposed max but acted that then couldve returned over half sensors now this point know this happens and when see some number like mgdl think okay its probably like realistically but does skew all the time range gmi etc estimations quite bit and have explain endo every time that shows significantly higher numbers the higher goes ive been hearing from lot diabetics and also from endo that most diabetics use cgms mainly and dont even prick their fingers anymore however trusted the sensor and gave doses based what said then would going low very often have problem with measuring from the finger but the problem that country they have started restricting the amount test strips they give and just tell you look your sensor still measure from finger before every meal because just dont trust still feel the cgm very useful looking how the blood sugar curve generally looks after different foods and tends quite accurate the mgdl range does help with low alarms which find necessity this point has anyone else experienced consistently very inaccurate readings higher levels\",\"besides other things that have

what the calibration was because couldnt prick finger the time theyve since gotten approval for the day sensor and maybe daily calibration requirements have changed like the simplicity putting new dexcom sensor home addition being able loop with omnipod tandem insulin pumps not sure eversense has any pump integrations years ago when used there was app bug that enabled you use the same sensor past the day expiration pushed the limit around months even longer what noticed overtime after extending the sensor was that accuracy high glucose levels wasnt good but still maintained accuracy normal and low levels example this would finger stick would say was but eversense said was from what heard the day sensor didnt change from the day sensor would kind skeptical being accurate highs for the whole days you decide try the insertion isnt bad they use lidocaine numb you and make small incision implant the device would absolutely use eversense was water athlete something similar for your

night get headache have hypoglycemia without diabetes during the day the censor goes off all day well\",\"the only things which helped were sleeping side the other arm putting the sensor the front the arm that would not laying also seemed like false lows and compressions lows more often occurred the first day using the sensor some say placing the sensor before actually scanning and using helps acclimate your skin better and reduce bogus initial readings the inside the upper arm another placement thats worked well for side sleeper long that part your arm isnt directly under your body doesnt tend get compressed there either ime also less likely knock against doorframes and stuff there havent personally noticed that putting the sensors early cuts down compression lows early but definitely does seem help with accuracy and stability general for the first day two give the fresh inflammation etc from punching hole your arm some time settle down before starting the new sensor\",\"give time personally whats called soaking where put sensor and not activate for hours this allows any trauma from placement calm down resulting more accurate readings when activated also you can try get
