the result are little different than the estimated glucose conversion are used youll see that give you instead the are accustomed again this based the database actual outcome not the math what should happen the paper go talk about what might causing all the variation tend think that the average glucose number more important than the gmi and even more important than the because there are thing that

the dexcom sensor are much better than the medtronic sensor and should wakeup call them just little backstory wa diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump wa the last one anima made and wa compatible with the dexcom think sensor loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensor were year later medtronic acquired anima and discontinued the pump and wa forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for year recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issue encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive wa garbage would regularly have sensor fall off after couple day dexcom can still properly stuck there for week the medtronic accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm need recalibrating constantly the very least every hour which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wake you dexcom calibration necessary it amazing this specific for but dexcom sensor are covered health care and the medtronic one where costing arm and leg the result all this wa that control wa significantly affected when wa the medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partner sleep and effected our relationship all all wa serious step backwards from where wa just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two system when wa moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concern when wa trying sell their new system what gathered wa that their closed loop system us the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirement and same terrible accuracy the old one can recommend anything would trying get looping using dexcom sensor and omnipods running off your phone it liberating best luck team hope the roller coaster not too extreme for you guy today edit wa the pump and the guardian sensor apparently the new one pretty good upgrade compared the older one that being said wa also looking article that echoed some same point above dono look the same and seems have the same problem someone read this who the fence dexcom just dont have major complaint about them theyre reliable accurate and convenient wa part the trial for the first medtronic sensor and remember hating them because wa still having test three time day although wa kid and wa trial there that now have the tslim with and can pretty confidently say the the only reason wa able get diabetes
