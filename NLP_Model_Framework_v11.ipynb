wa diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump wa the last one anima made and wa compatible with the dexcom think sensor loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensor were year later medtronic acquired anima and discontinued the pump and wa forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for year recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted

the medtronic cgm adhesive wa garbage would regularly have sensor fall off after couple day dexcom can still properly stuck there for week the medtronic accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm need recalibrating constantly the very least every hour which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wake you dexcom calibration necessary it amazing this specific for but dexcom sensor are covered health care and the medtronic one where costing arm and leg the result all this wa that control wa significantly affected when wa the medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine

that could better for one there way silence certain alarm and they can pretty annoying for example you have critical low blood sugar under mgdl you get alarm from dexcom make sense and you will also get alarm from the pod itself and also the omnipod app bit much okay lot alarm sound overwhelming but hoping the insurance part sustainable the pro outweigh con this will first ever pump hows omnipod

etc trying find patch cover hole luck accurate hole sensor covered anyone know patch cover thank\",\"personally wouldnt bother started dexcom nearly the beginning and wa amazing when they lasted for

the dex solution full acc\",\"dexcoms stelo their new noninsulin day and probably cheaper sensor this wa mentioned month ago being development specifically for noninsulin type glad see it going reality look out summer edit take this from the article and what read elsewhere previously that the app will remove the alarm for high and low maybe the lessened liability make for le costly production somehow dont really see the sampling rate getting stretched any farther than the existing minute because that get into the unusable territory with reading too far apart based what ceo claimed interview last year will last day\",\"dexcom versus freestyle libre sick and tired lost signal and erratic reading dexcom people would limit discussion trouble praise for one device the other love hear from those with firsthand experience having used both system thank you\",\"anyone else dexcom look like this all over the place while awake and trend are very inconsistent but then stable

people about what headphone wearing they ask and ill talk the people\",\"ive been unlucky enough use the dexcom one and the libre all using android phone the dexcom one the moment which current prescription could choose then would for the but only because the app offer the ataglance feature phone lock screen the dexcom one app doesnt have this have unlock phone and open the dexcom app see the dexcom once doesnt have app that run pixel watch either term application comfort and accuracy have not noticed any difference the smaller with lower profile than the one which the same size and shape the being able calibrate the dexcoms against finger prick seems make more accurate than the libre that need calibrating and after it been calibrated dexcoms are complete pain you get sensor that need calibrating have never personally had issue with the adhesive it always stayed and never caused irritation regardless which device use thanks used them when they first came out the calibration issue including for sensor are burnt into psyche pixel and using fitbit doubt will work the fitbit may try the dexcom one and get round buying pixel watch consider the then ill self funding and hope

something white your body for straight day good idea the alert the app theyre quiet and short and linked the medium sound this actually piss off the most and make really upset haha with the libre the alert overrode all volume setting and kept beeping until you actually acknowledged least think the point that wa loud enough and long enough that you had plenty time hear and react downloaded xdrip and use companion app solve that problem but xdrip frequently miss reading several time hour it only updating every min worried that going have overnight low and sleep right through second sensor reading were wildly different than the finger stick even after several day and calibration they had send different one accidentally hit the corner the wall with arm and the sensor tore right off the adhesive and everything all the patch were left arm nothing even remotely close this ever happened with the libre most recent sensor upon warmup said sugar wa meter said never had problem with the libre taking fing hour accurate fact wa accurate immediately anyway thanks for listening just needed vent hahaha also had adapt the switch had mindful not inserting new one during spike and learning calibrate reading with finger stick during the first hr some will spot others will take bit but then remain accurate allergic the over patch found colorful hypoallergenic one amazon they also have black these helped keep mine and looking fresh think there are couple different phone apps link your dexcom but currently only using the receiver there might better alarm setting one the others not familiar with xdrip wonder you can get like audio kind like those dancing light kid toy maybe you can sleep with something like that nearby know there also new large display clock with alarm that you have hit like alarm clock\",\"dexcom goal what are everyones thought this last two week look like youre doing great job there couple not good day but those happen all think goal tir but cant use the

hear only from people have switched from with system the other please thank you\",\"libre plus keep reading about new version the libre called plus any idea what offer depending it just that specific addon you are waiting for then there are real big gamechanger update the plus version versus the old one have but the big thing that approved for being the sensor source interface direct with the tandem tslim insulin pump using the controliq technology and abbott also promise the plus version give day sensor life from formally gaining one more day duration with those two thing are really the difference far aware use the xdrip app and not abbotts own app also getting more default that way anyway the sensor doe indeed run that long without problem it only abbotts app that shuts down but personally actually like the week window between switching sensor will probably stick this matter even offered one more full day it like fixed routine for every second sunday morning and that give some comfort the change day home where the potential erratic warmup reading caused new sensor are le mission critical for\",\"omnipod and dexcom hello currently dexcom and want attempt the omnipod connection the auto system really appealing adhd can make hard remember insulin hoping get some opinion from those who have used them together and maybe ask few question how the cost for omnipod user

still requires daily calibration which can annoying granted there were time where would just put the exact number that the eversense app told wa and say thats what the calibration wa because couldnt

with omnipod tandem insulin pump not sure eversense ha any pump integration year ago when used there wa app bug that enabled you use the same sensor past the day expiration pushed the limit around month even longer what noticed overtime after extending the sensor wa that accuracy high glucose level wasnt good but still maintained accuracy normal and low level example this would finger stick would say wa but eversense said wa from what heard the day sensor didnt change from the day sensor would kind skeptical being accurate high for the whole day you decide try the insertion isnt bad they use lidocaine numb you and make small incision implant the device would absolutely use eversense wa water athlete something similar for your dexcom falling off shave your skin and clean with rubbing alcohol and apply skintac before putting the dexcom doing should ensure that doesnt fall off for long time you could even put overlay patch top you were frequently taking bubble bath something like
