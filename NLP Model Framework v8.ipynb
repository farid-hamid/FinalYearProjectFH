just little backstory was diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump was the last one animas made and was compatible with the dexcom think sensors loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensors were years later medtronic acquired animas and discontinued the pump and was forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for years recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issues encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive was garbage would regularly have sensors fall off after couple days dexcom can still properly stuck there for weeks the medtronic accuracy was awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm needs recalibrating constantly the very least every hours which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wakes you dexcom calibration necessary its amazing this specific for but dexcom sensors are covered health care and the medtronic ones where costing arm and leg the result all this was that control was significantly affected when was the medtronic pump sensors falling off would often leave for long periods where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant was hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustments worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partners sleep and effected our relationship all all was serious step backwards from where was just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two systems when was moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concerns when was trying sell their new system what gathered was that their closed loop system uses the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirements and same terrible accuracy the old one can recommend anything would trying get looping using dexcom sensors and omnipods running off your phone its liberating best luck team hope the roller coasters not too extreme for you guys today edit was the pump and the guardian sensor apparently the new one pretty good

about months ago paid for the reader and per sensor and have used sensors three sensors outright failed the other sensors gave readings that were off more that points have had the sensor report when

inaccurate cgm readings higher blood sugar levels ive been using cgms for few years now and ive noticed over the years that blood sugar over mmoll mgdl then the readings get significantly higher than what the finger pricks show this hasnt just been occasional faulty sensors but ive observed this same behavior most not all sensor ive used over years for example right now sensor showing mgdl while from the finger was mgdl and wasnt changing had been flatlining for hours last sensor had instance where was showing mgdl the sensor but was mgdl from finger another annoying thing related this the sensor tends correct itself accurate reading around mgdl which shows instant drop like mgdl this then triggers start predicting low and triggering alarms since dropped quickly know the margin error supposed max but acted that then couldve returned over half sensors now this point know this happens and when see some number like mgdl think okay its probably like realistically but does skew all the time range gmi etc estimations quite bit and have explain endo every time that shows significantly higher numbers the higher goes ive been hearing from lot diabetics and also from endo that most diabetics use cgms mainly and dont even prick their fingers anymore however trusted the sensor and gave doses based what said then would going low very often have problem with measuring from the finger but the problem that country they have started restricting the amount test strips they give and just tell you look your sensor still measure from finger before every meal because just dont trust still feel the cgm very useful looking how the blood sugar curve generally looks after different foods and tends quite accurate the mgdl range does help with low alarms which find necessity this

the libre would lot easier get past insurance and asked would try told him because was very happy with the but admittedly have not seen power user comparison review from someone who can articulate pros and cons however mentioned that the libre would lot easier get past insurance and asked would try dont think your doctor would have much clue for example insurer has deal with dexcom and covers

ataglance feature phones lock screen the dexcom one app doesnt have this have unlock phone and open the dexcom app see the dexcom once doesnt have app that runs pixel watch either terms application comfort and accuracy have not noticed any difference the smaller with lower profile than the one which the same size and shape the being able calibrate the dexcoms against finger prick seems make more accurate than the libre that needs calibrating and after its been calibrated dexcoms are complete pain you get sensor that needs calibrating have never personally had issues with the adhesive its always stayed and never caused irritation regardless which device use thanks used them when they first came out the calibration issues including for sensor are burnt into psyche pixel and using fitbit doubt will work the fitbit may try the dexcom one and get round buying pixel watch consider the then ill self funding and hope this will avoid having back insulin but have feeling that may forlorn

else noticed the readings are usually off still using meter confirm but been feeling really sick again for the first time months tired everyone praising having meter because you don have prick your finger much but still when haven been feeling well can keep sugars prior having dexcom some days would checking day know body the hypo side average glucose level but most the time the thought the was going help wouldn have lose much sleep the night but still checking frequently because always off\",\"depends dexcom out the first hour wonkiness and has been reliable for the session tend trust for lows that make sense given how was trending prior there are times feel off before dexcom gets low stick finger dexcom buzzes with low haven felt yet stick finger below certain level wakes mid just eat

thing the app did not know this have never had this suggestion and have been using the dexcom for almost years hate the warmup adjustment have complained and asked drs and dex thank you seen the new round and was just wondering they might have fixed some more the calibration issues\",\"for was two things that made the freestle better the first was size dexcom very bulky and the filament was lot longer found the painful and cumbersome wear the second was the alarms use the reader for the freestyle which allows put all alarms vibrate only andor turn them off the dexcom has urgent low that you can not turn off which means you get even after treating due the delay the sensor lastly personally found dexcom less accurate but noticed the freestyle also had issues when used the app maybe app thing\",\"dexcom libre thinking about getting either the dexcom one the libre follow blood glucose levels which the two would you recommend many thanks\",\"peoples experience dexcom one after years

during the first couple days proper hydration helps settle properly calibration only when stable you can calibrate over time and the algorithm will eventually settle and give good readings the first day always rocky its the nature the beast most have come the consensus where the device inserted the body trying heal the trauma messes with the readings friends who have used both swear dexcom have only ever used dexcom thats all know when was diagnosed asked several people who knew were what with and hands down the lifelong veterans all said tandem and dexcom were the best until the next big breakthrough comes along have experience with months months and months the best results had were was using\",\"they all have that same flaw and chance for that happen one better more recommended remember that they read interstitial fluid not blood dehydrated they inaccurate leaning the sensor too firmly inaccurate there are few studies that have shown that hydration status outside extremes has virtually impact cgm accuracy this more less old wives tale that dexcomlibre users have perpetuated the volume interstitial fluid fairly tightly controlled the body love that people downvote but can dispute lol\",\"they are water resistant long the transmitter fully snapped shower every day and sometimes twice day and the water doesn this how many days old the sensor they are water resistant

effects readings\",\"for all dexcom users you still prick your fingers you solely rely your dexcom you still prick your finger make sure the reading accurate\",\"which also cgn and yes sometimes will bleed but this will typically mess readings will typically replace with new one but thats just\",\"looking for thoughts those who have used both the dexcom and the freestyle libre sick and tired lost

experience having used both systems hoping hear only from people have switched from with system the other please thank you\",\"ive had approximately day eversense implants its accurate however believe still requires daily calibrations which can annoying granted there were times where would just put the exact number that the eversense app told was and say thats what the calibration was because couldnt prick finger the time theyve since gotten approval for the day sensor and maybe daily calibration requirements have changed like the simplicity putting new dexcom sensor home addition being able loop with omnipod tandem insulin pumps not sure eversense has any pump integrations years ago when used there was app bug that enabled you use the same sensor past the day expiration pushed the limit around months even longer what noticed overtime after extending the sensor was that accuracy high glucose levels wasnt good but still maintained accuracy normal and low levels example this would finger stick would say was but eversense said was from what heard the day sensor didnt change from the day sensor would kind skeptical being accurate highs for the whole days you decide try the insertion isnt bad they use lidocaine numb you and make small incision implant the device would absolutely use eversense was water athlete something similar for your dexcom falling off shave your skin and clean with rubbing alcohol and apply skintac before putting the dexcom doing should ensure that doesnt fall off for long time you could even put overlay patch top you were frequently taking bubble baths something like that lol\",\"you can use both\",\"will the adhesive cover that comes with the dexcom actually stay first day using dexcom switching librei like libre wanted try something
