            "1: frustrated with libre just got off the phone with customer support about sensor put left arm day ago wa giving inaccurate low for example the cgm read and finger prick wa they are sending free replacement removed and put new one other arm scanned after the hour and read and finger prick wa like beyond frustrated the outside upper arm have not been laying just don know what also noticed that ever since switched over the libre reading not automatically log into daily log doe this happen anyone else well there something can trouble shoot frustrated currently week pregnant and frustrating not able trust reading\n",

            "1: confused gmi libre finding myself confused the gmi measurement libre wear one these all the time last day average glucose yet it telling gmi would when look say the gmi basically your estimated yet according various chart online average glucose going land more around thats prediabetic actually diabetic can someone explain where it getting this number when none the conversion chart match have libre set mgdl for everything underneath the say mmolmol put several measurement per day mysugr well record meal there and several glucose measurement and keep with case out sensor and fingerstick for day two and that day average saying for the record mysugr estimate what the heck libre\n",
            "0: freestyle libre ive been using the freestyle libre cgm system since early december but relatively new type diagnosed early nov and experiencing lot problem with and wanted see wa the only one first sensor fell off arm day early and then the next one replaced with fell off the same day arm wa not wet sweaty anything and didnt accidentally bump arm dont get but together thats day monitoring just got cheated out and these sensor are not cheap paying out pocket because insurance wont cover for type second began noticing that body didnt feel the way the score app were saying level were started double checking with fingerstick glucometer accucheck and later prodigy found that freestyle libre sensor wa reporting wildly different level than fingersticks were showing like much point more off time and happened with more than one cgm sensor sure wasnt just faulty sensor ha anyone else experienced this out sensor now and will have renew prescription for them and then pay lot out pocket get more just trying decide it worth the hassle not\n",
            "0: freestyle libre possible set the new sensor while the old sensor still ha time left dont have gap reading like would place the new sensor other arm and activate while the old sensor still ha hour left the old sensor dy right the new sensor kick doe this work not possible have sensor going\n",

            "1: over tape libre using trial unit wondering showering and sweat during exercise affect should using over tape reason for wanting try this that going back bike racing the spring cycling normally drop blood sugar from pt depending the distance this could mean stopping check regularly prefer avoid that and use cgm have appt wednesday and ask about but curious what others experience with getting this thing wet\n",
            "1: dexcom freestyle libre newly diagnosed and doctor said that don really need check blood glucose yet but data nerd and bought ketoneglucose blood device and quickly becoming obsessed with knowing what change happen with every thing that planning asking doctor for cgm and like the idea the smaller sensor version these two device what everyone opinion\n"

accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm need recalibrating constantly the very least every hour which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wake you dexcom calibration necessary it amazing this specific for but dexcom sensor are covered health care and the medtronic one where costing arm and leg the result all this wa that control wa significantly affected when wa the medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random

after different food and tends quite accurate the mgdl range doe help with low alarm which find necessity this point ha anyone else experienced consistently very inaccurate reading higher level\",\"besides other thing that have been mentioned glucose sensor can have larger variance during the first hour when compare actual blood glucose due the very minor damage caused the insertion device needle and your body reacting external object the filament the sensor mine often show too low value for the first day insert new sensor least day before activate them omg thank you for letting know wish had known this when inserted sensor are all those option via the internet\",\"ugh dexcom customer service since dexcom switched their budget how many replacement you allotted noticed their even more cold had two sensor fail back back fault own yet they refuse replace both because asking too often they replace one but not the other miss the day when dexcom wa san diego site their corporate headquarters staffed people with diabetes who actually understood what the device did ohhhh the old\",\"and it not dangerous the general consensus that bleeder are reader aka give you good reading from whar can tell it freaky when happens but thats about thanks for the feedback occurs again should just keep until the bleeding stop wa coming out the opening the left the word dexcom the
