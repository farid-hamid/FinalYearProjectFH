            "1: frustrated with libre just got off the phone with customer support about sensor put left arm day ago wa giving inaccurate low for example the cgm read and finger prick wa they are sending free replacement removed and put new one other arm scanned after the hour and read and finger prick wa like beyond frustrated the outside upper arm have not been laying just don know what also noticed that ever since switched over the libre reading not automatically log into daily log doe this happen anyone else well there something can trouble shoot frustrated currently week pregnant and frustrating not able trust reading\n",

            "1: confused gmi libre finding myself confused the gmi measurement libre wear one these all the time last day average glucose yet it telling gmi would when look say the gmi basically your estimated yet according various chart online average glucose going land more around thats prediabetic actually diabetic can someone explain where it getting this number when none the conversion chart match have libre set mgdl for everything underneath the say mmolmol put several measurement per day mysugr well record meal there and several glucose measurement and keep with case out sensor and fingerstick for day two and that day average saying for the record mysugr estimate what the heck libre\n",

            "1: over tape libre using trial unit wondering showering and sweat during exercise affect should using over tape reason for wanting try this that going back bike racing the spring cycling normally drop blood sugar from pt depending the distance this could mean stopping check regularly prefer avoid that and use cgm have appt wednesday and ask about but curious what others experience with getting this thing wet\n",
            "1: dexcom freestyle libre newly diagnosed and doctor said that don really need check blood glucose yet but data nerd and bought ketoneglucose blood device and quickly becoming obsessed with knowing what change happen with every thing that planning asking doctor for cgm and like the idea the smaller sensor version these two device what everyone opinion\n"

are much better than the medtronic sensor and should wakeup call them just little backstory wa diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump wa the last one anima made and wa compatible with the

for year recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issue encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive wa garbage would regularly have sensor fall off after couple day dexcom can still properly stuck there for week the medtronic accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm need recalibrating constantly the very least every hour which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wake you dexcom calibration necessary it amazing this specific for but dexcom sensor are covered health care and the medtronic one where costing arm and leg the result all this wa that control wa significantly affected when wa the medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partner sleep and effected our relationship all all wa serious step backwards from where wa just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two system when wa moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concern when wa trying sell their new system what
