from the finger  was mgdl and  wasnt changing  had been flatlining for  hours last sensor  had  instance where  was showing mgdl  the sensor but was  mgdl from finger\\n\\nanother annoying thing

\\n\\n was diagnosed   and got  pump soon after that  first pump was the last one animas made and was compatible with the dexcom   think sensors  loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensors were  years later medtronic acquired animas and discontinued the pump and  was forced  switch  the medtronic pump with their cgm system for  years \\n\\nrecently  have switched  the omnipod system using the dexcom    sensor and  wanted  jump  here  compare them\\n\\nthe dexcom system  fantastic better  every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made  control worse the main issues  encountered with the medtronic system were\\n\\n  the medtronic cgm adhesive was garbage \\u2014  would regularly have sensors fall off after  couple days dexcom can still  properly stuck  there for weeks\\n the medtronic accuracy was awful \\u2014 consistently    mmoll  mgdl off and would get worse through the life  the sensor dexcom  consistently bang  accurate after over  week\\n the medtronic cgm needs recalibrating constantly  the very least every  hours which  super annoying  you calibrated  the middle  the day forget  recalibrate before you   bed and  wakes you  dexcom  calibration necessary its amazing\\n this  specific for  but dexcom sensors are covered   health care and the medtronic ones where costing   arm and  leg\\n\\nthe result  all  this was that  control was significantly affected when  was  the medtronic pump sensors falling off would often leave  for long periods where  had  sensor and fell back  fingersticks the poor accuracy meant  was hesitant  trust the reading from the cgm  make adjustments  worse take the wrong dose dependant  the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and  partners sleep and effected our relationship all  all  was  serious step backwards from where  was \\n\\n just wanted  put this out there   bit  first hand experience with the two systems when  was moving  this system  talked  the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concerns when  was trying  sell   their new system what  gathered was that their closed loop system uses the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirements and same terrible accuracy  the old one \\n\\n  can recommend anything  would  trying  get looping using dexcom sensors and omnipods running off your phone its liberating\\n\\nbest  luck
