NLP Model Framework consisting of a BERTopic Model to perform unsupervised learning on a text corpus, producing topic labels. 
The labelled embedded dataset then trains multi-topic text classifiers and the performance of different multi-class classification algorithms is compared and evaluated for the use case.
The discussion documents of concern in this framework are from Diabetes subReddits where dialogue around Continuous Glucose Monitoring systems is common.
