cgm says ill feature next sensor still days left current sensor wont find til\",\"medtronic should embarrassed dexcom tldr the dexcom sensors are much better than the medtronic sensors and should wakeup call them just little backstory was diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump was the last one animas made and was compatible with the dexcom think sensors loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensors were years later medtronic acquired animas and discontinued the pump and was forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for years recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issues encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive was garbage would regularly have sensors fall off after couple days dexcom can still properly stuck there for weeks the medtronic accuracy was awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm needs recalibrating constantly the very least every hours which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wakes you dexcom calibration necessary its amazing this specific for but dexcom sensors are covered health care and the medtronic ones where costing arm and leg the result all this was that control was significantly affected when was the medtronic pump sensors falling off would often leave for long periods where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant was hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustments worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partners sleep and effected our relationship all all was serious step backwards from where was just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two systems when was moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concerns when was trying sell their new system what gathered was that their closed loop system uses the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirements and same terrible accuracy the old one can recommend anything would trying get looping using dexcom sensors and omnipods running off your phone its liberating best luck team hope the roller coasters not too extreme for you guys today edit was the pump and the guardian sensor apparently the new one pretty good

going low you were using insulin type iirc you would going low you were using insulin type iirc type checking use units day\",\"yeah kinda know the trend was just odd since for the past days the

able rely its accuracy ive also miraculously never had sensor actually bad the since switched from the day which had bad sensors maybe half dozen times more over period not discounting that many people have had issues with the sensors but can only experience whatever the reasons may even just luck anyway ifwhen rarely get low state will feel long before the cgm will report and ill finger stick verify cant recall the last time ive had true low overnight where alarm would critical and when the signal loss does occur typically comes back within minute two max for ive never even thought about replacing sensor because this were many hours though might for now feels like minor inconvenience but can certainly see this major issue for those who may need rely consistency and alarms\",\"libre sensor and party hello currently using fsl trying find devices apps covert cgm anything found far doesnt seem work version any help appreciated thank unable switch libre anything else

years that blood sugar over mmoll mgdl then the readings get significantly higher than what the finger pricks show this hasnt just been occasional faulty sensors but ive observed this same behavior most not all sensor ive used over years for example right now sensor showing mgdl while from the finger was mgdl and wasnt changing had been flatlining for hours last sensor had instance where was showing mgdl the sensor but was mgdl from finger another annoying thing related this the sensor tends correct itself accurate reading around mgdl which shows instant drop like mgdl this then triggers start predicting low and triggering alarms since dropped quickly know the margin error supposed max but acted that then couldve returned over half sensors now this point know this happens and when see some number like mgdl think okay its probably like realistically but does skew all the time range gmi etc estimations quite bit and have explain endo every time that shows significantly higher numbers the higher goes ive been hearing from lot diabetics and also from endo that most diabetics use cgms mainly and dont even prick their fingers anymore however trusted the sensor and gave doses based what said then would going low very often have problem with measuring from the finger but the problem that country they have started restricting the amount test strips they give and just tell you look your sensor still measure from finger before every meal because just dont trust still feel the cgm very useful looking how the blood sugar curve generally looks after different foods and tends quite accurate the mgdl range does help with low alarms which find necessity this point has anyone else experienced consistently very inaccurate readings higher levels\",\"most the time means you are

noticed overtime after extending the sensor was that accuracy high glucose levels wasnt good but still maintained accuracy normal and low levels example this would finger stick would say was but
