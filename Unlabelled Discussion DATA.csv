diabetes_t2,05/12/2023,05/12/2023 23:25,Cheapest way to get a CGM without insurance?,"Well after being told my insurance would cover a freestyle libre 3, I just received a letter in the mail telling me that I don't qualify for any CGM because I don't take insulin.

I'd really like to figure out my actual highs and lows instead of random guessing about timing. And get a better idea of exactly how each food is hitting me and what my dawn phenomenon looks like through the night. 

It looks like a freestyle libre 3 is about $70 which means $140/month. I can't afford that. I know you can get your first one for free through their website but does anyone know any other ways to reduce the cost? Even if I can only do it temporarily, maybe I can get a few months worth of data. I'm in the US: Michigan.",,,,,
diabetes_t2,20/12/2023,20/12/2023 05:13,Libre 3 doesn’t stick,"I’ve used the Libre 3 for 3 months off and on. I wish I had it on more consistently, but I’ve never had a unit stay on more than 7 days. It’s been so frustrating. They’ve never come off because of any force or accident, they just become loose. 

I’m pregnant now, and would like to be able to wear a CGM for the duration of my pregnancy. What gives? Please send any advice!",,,,,
diabetes_t2,23/12/2023,23/12/2023 23:16,Frustrated with Libre 3,"I just got off the phone with customer support about a sensor I put on my left arm 3 days ago. It was giving me inaccurate lows. For example, the CGM read 130 and my finger prick was 191. They are sending me a free replacement so I removed it and put a new one on my other arm. I scanned after the 1 hour and it read 119 and my finger prick was 179. I am like beyond frustrated. It’s on the outside of my upper arm. I have not been laying on it. I just don’t know what’s up. Also, I noticed that ever since I switched over to the Libre 3, readings do not automatically log into my daily log. Does this happen to anyone else as well? Is there something I can do to trouble shoot? I’m frustrated as I’m currently 12 weeks pregnant and it’s frustrating to not be able to trust my readings.",,,,,

I’ve worked SO HARD since being diagnosed on Nov 30tg. I felt incredibly hopeless when I was diagnosed but immediately decided to change my life around. 

I know it’s a 24/7/365 thing and I’ve still got a ways to go but I just wanted to brag on myself a bit and, more importantly, to say that a diagnosis is sometimes a second chance at turning your health around.",,,,,
diabetes_t2,07/12/2023,07/12/2023 16:34,Confused by GMI on Libre 3,"I'm finding myself confused by the GMI measurement on my Libre 3. I wear one of these all the time. My last 71 days, my average glucose is 122. Yet, it's telling me my GMI would be 6.5. When I look it up, it says the GMI is basically your estimated A1C. Yet, according to various charts online, a 122 average glucose is going to land me more around 5.9. That's prediabetic vs. actually diabetic!
Can someone explain to me where it's getting this number when none of the conversion charts match it?
I have my libre set to mg/dl for everything. Underneath the 6.5%, it says (48 mmol/mol).
I put several measurements per day in mySugr as well (I record meals there and several glucose measurements and keep up with it in case I am out of a sensor and fingerstick for a day or two), and that 90 day average is saying 121. For the record, mySugr estimates my A1C to be 5.8. What the heck, libre?!",,,,,
diabetes_t2,30/01/2023,30/01/2023 20:57,Freestyle Libre 3,"So I've been using the Freestyle Libre 3 CGM system since early December 2022 but I am relatively new to Type II (diagnosed in early Nov 2022) and I'm experiencing a lot of problems with it and wanted to see if I was the only one.
First, a sensor fell off my arm 5 days early and then the next one I replaced it with fell off the same day. My arm was not wet or sweaty or anything and I didn't accidentally bump my arm so I don't get it. But together that's 19 days of monitoring I just got cheated out of and these sensors are NOT cheap (I'm paying out of pocket because my insurance won't cover for type II).
Second, I began noticing that my body didn't feel the way the scores on my app were saying my BG levels were at so I started double checking with my fingerstick glucometer (AccuCheck and later Prodigy). I found that my Freestyle Libre 3 sensor was reporting wildly different BG levels than my fingersticks were showing. Like as much as 30 points or more off at times. And it happened with more than one CGM sensor so I'm sure it wasn't just a faulty sensor.
Has anyone else experienced this?? I'm out of sensors now and will have to renew my prescription for them and then pay a lot out of pocket to get more so I'm just trying to decide if its worth the hassle or not. . . .",,,,,

My reason for wanting to try this is that I’m going to go back to bike racing in the spring. Cycling normally drops my blood sugar from 5-20 pts. Depending on the distance this could mean stopping to check regularly. I’d prefer to avoid that and use a CGM. I have a dr appt on Wednesday and I’ll ask about it but curious what others experience with getting this thing wet.,,,,,

diabetes_t2,14/02/2023,14/02/2023 16:04,Issue getting Libre freestyle 3,"I had my doc get me an rx for Libre freestyle 3 and I got the discount info from Abbott to pay $75 for 2 sensors. 

Unfortunately, Walmart would only allow me to get one sensor. My rx even says fill up to 4, but Walmart says I can only ever get one sensor at a time and EVERY SINGLE TIME I want a new one, my doctor has to send a new rx. They can’t just say refill it x times. The pharmacist said I will have come back every 12 days and get a new one. 

Does anyone else have this absurd issue? Does this sound like just a stupid Walmart rule? It is not an insurance rule as I am going out of pocket.",,,,,
diabetes_t2,23/02/2023,23/02/2023 17:14,"Those of you with Libre CGM, do you trust the numbers?","Hi All, 

I went ahead a purchased 2 Libre 3 sensors out of pocket. My doctor wouldn't prescribe it for me because she said it isn't medically necessary. I decided it was best to have some insight into my numbers, what foods trigger big spikes, and my progress with the diet and lifestyle changes. So I paid full price.

With that said, I am feeling like I can't trust the numbers. For context I am 47M, I weighed 320 when diagnosed. My A1C was a 7.2. I was diagnosed in Jan. 23. I take metformin 500mg twice a day.

I started really cutting out the carbs shortly after diagnosis. Then I decided to do keto and IF (16/8 for now) because the ADA diet guidelines seemed completely crazy to me.

I have had the first Libre 3 sensor applied for basically two full days. I set my target range to be 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl. In the two days, I have not seen any spikes above 121. I do understand there is lag between the CGM and a blood glucos test. However, whenever I test my blood, I am between 108 and 125. For part of the day, when I compensate for lag, the CGM seems pretty close. ut sometimes it seems way off.

I guess I am just worried that the progress it looks like I am making is an illusion. I really want to believe that I am doing the right things for my body. I know this is a marathon, not a sprint, but I also figure you gotta train the right way to run a marathon.

So any of you with the Libre 3 (or others), do you trust the readings?",,,,,

This morning she changed her sensor, after the hour she went to scan it and it gives the message “The sensor you just scanned was started by another reader and cannot be used with this one.” 
Her pharmacist suggested taking it out and switching but my question is will it still say this? 
Since removing it we haven’t put any other sensor on and it’s still reading this message and saying that it has 14 days left. 
I suppose the question is if we were to put another sensor on would it override this? Or is there any thing else I could do to fix it ?

A few time it was even well over 200. Once it was 225, but when I checked it with a glucometers, it was 140. I waited 30 min and checked the sensor again and it was stll above 200.
Today was the 2 week mark and I changed my sensor. This time I put it about 3 inches higher on my right arm. It's been on for about 2 hours. I've checked by blood glucose a dozen times so far, and by blood glucose has been below 130 the whole time. I haven't double checked with a glucometer yet to double check the readings. But at least the ratings now are more consistent. With the old sensor, my blood glucose to switch from 225 to 150 in about 5 minutes. I was in the ER with another problem and it said my blood glucose was 129. I put on my sneakers and checked it again, just for sh\*ts and giggles and it was 210.

diabetes_t2,20/02/2023,20/02/2023 19:23,anyone else have FreeStyle Libre fail all the time?,"I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes \~1 year ago. For a while, I was using FreeStyle Libre glucose monitors -- the kind you plug into your arm for 2 weeks at a stretch. I liked it way better than finger pricks. It wasn't as accurate, but it was accurate enough that I felt it was useful. Then, several months ago, they just started failing for me. I've tried using \~6 devices since then, and every single one of them has failed within \~2 days. By ""failed"", I mean, the readings show blood sugar off the charts low, unless I really overdo it on carbs, then it registers a blip. I tried complaining to the company once, but it's a PITA process to do so and a replacement device wouldn't really help anyway, given they've so consistently failed in recent months.
I did have one major change in my medication recently. My doctor added Jardiance into the mix. I'm now on 3 different medications (metformin, glipizide, and jardiance), and I'm wondering if the jardiance in somehow incompatible with the sensors.
Any solid answers would be appreciated!",,,,,

When my husband picked it up and brought it home, I looked up the app and currently the apple app is broken, hasn't been updated in 6 months, and there's hundreds of very recent comments complaining about it. I can't return the sensors, so I'm going to set them up with my husband's phone (he works from home, so it's an inconvenience, but I can still scan it a few times a day with his phone). What continuous monitors do people like? Is the Libre 2 fine with an android? I have an older one I could try and dig out to use just as a reader.

Due to the usual job-change/insurance-change dance I had to switch doctors. She has me talking to a full team of people, including an endocrinologist. The nurse gave me a CGM to try and it has been a game changer in terms of giving me a view of how my physiology behaves in this condition. Absolutely incredible. It's really change my approach to it, 

This screenshot is the last 12 day's daily number overlayed. It's allowed me to truly see which foods affect me the most. I am hoping for a prescription to keep using it; at least for a while.

The big change so far has been to understand the 'dawn effect' and also how low my level gets overnight. I have modified the timing of my meds as a result.

I continued the setup and turned off notifications, but the app will not let me continue without turning on critical notifications. It also says that it's going to ping my phone every minute to give me a reading.
I don't want it pinging my phone every minute. I much prefer how the Libre 2 did things. It could queue up your data in the sensor. Then you tap the reader, and it grabbed the delta from the last tap.
What if I was an 80-year-old Type 2 diabetic without a smartphone? How could I use this thing?
I understand the FDA just approved the reader for the Libre 3. I'm definitely buying that, unless I am going to need to carry it around all the time to avoid alarms.

diabetes_t2,01/07/2023,01/07/2023 13:16,Confusing GC Readings on Libre FreeStyle 2 vs. Finger Stick,"I have been using Libre FreeStyle 2 monitor for some time now but the readings, most of the time, are completely different from my finger stick readings. For example, just this morning, here are a few of the readings to show what I am talking about. (And by the way, I have the stupid ""Dawn Phenomenon"" going on, so my morning readings are always high.)
This morning at **3:02 a.m**., reading with **FStyle2 was 160**. (I always need to go to the bathroom several times a night, so when I am up, I take a reading.)
Then at **5:02 a.m**., the reading was **175**. At **6:02 a.m**., reading of **155**. (This reading didn't make any sense to me as my glucose always goes up in the morning until I take my insulin shot.) At **6:15 a.m**. it was **190.** Because my BG went up 35 points in a matter of 13 minutes**,** I tested with a **finger stick** and it read **164** at **6:18 a.m.** I took my insulin shot (20 U of Regular and 18 U of N) and waited for about 45 minutes to test again. So, at **7:01 a.m**. the **FStyle2** reading was **164** and the **finger stick** was **184**. ???? I will ask my doctor about this, but I am concerned as to which readings were correct. Which reading do I go by?? Any ideas?",,,,,

Aside from the known issues with the G7, has anyone else noticed the readings are usually off by 10-20? I’m still using my meter to confirm but I’ve been feeling really sick again for the first time in months. I’m tired of everyone praising having a meter because “you don’t have to prick your finger so much” but I still do. When I haven’t been feeling well or can’t keep my sugars up, prior to having my dexcom some days I would be checking 7x a day. I know my body. I’m on the hypo side, I average a glucose level of 95, but most of the time I’m in the 60’s-70’s. I thought the G7 was going to help so I wouldn’t have to lose so much sleep in the night but I’m still checking frequently because it’s always off.",,,,,

I’ve been reading about people consistently paying only $175 for a month use of Dexcom 6. Yesterday I went to Costco w a Rx for 1 month of sensors, 1 transmitter and 1 receiver. The pharmacist applied the GoodRx coupon and the total was over $500! I haven’t paid for it yet because the receiver was out of stock and due to come today- but what am I missing that this costs so much?",,,,,
diabetes_t2,17/07/2023,17/07/2023 19:30,CGM bounce around with the insurance company.,"So, I've been using the Freestyle Libre 2 for a while now. I recently got a notice from my insurance company that I am supposed to switch to the Libre 3.

Now because I am a T2 with good blood sugar control (Yay keto!), the insurance would not pay for the CGM, but I got it at a ""negotiated rate"" of $35 per sensor.

On Saturday, I took off my last Libre 2 sensor. By the time I took it off, the pharmacy was closed for the day, and they're closed all day Sunday. So, today I drive over to the pharmacy and the pharmacist tells me I can't fill the prescription till Wednesday. This left me scratching my head. How can the insurance company gate-keep a prescription they're not even paying for.

I get home and call the insurance company and they tell me they no longer offer the Freestyle. I now need to get a Dexcom. And I need to get ""prior authorization"" for the Dexcom. They cover both the G6 and G7.

The last time I got prior authorization for the Dexcom, they denied it because I wasn't sick enough. To get the Dexcom, I needed to be an insulin dependent diabetic with consistently bad blood sugar control.

So, I feel like I am going through the same song and dance I went through last year, probably to get denied again. I'm more than willing to get the G7, assuming I can get a reader for it and not use my phone.",,,,,

So, I'm so damn curious. I'm I a dumbass if I do it",,,,,

The first few days I when it was time to check my glucose level, I checked both with Libre and IME-DC. The average difference was 13.5 and I rounded it to 15. Today I woke up with Libre telling me 111 and IME-DC 167. How is that possible? Libre shows my glucose level has been fluctuating between 90-120 during the night but now I don't believe it. I was really happy to wake up to a pretty nice blood sugar, since my A1C was 12.8 a month ago.
How do I fix this and what causes it? Is it possible the Libre got ""worn out"" and is acting up because it's on its last days? The difference wasn't this big previously. Now I don't know how to calculate my glucose level with Libre alone, which creates a difficulty in school.",,,,,

Freestylelibre,12/11/2023,12/11/2023 16:03,Libre 3 Alarms android/iOS,"Hi there! Can anybody help out? I'm practically seething with rage because this app is so crappy. Apart from the myriad of issues that I have with this app in general, the alarms in particular bother me.

I use Android on a Redmi 11 Note pro if that helps (also German version of libre 3). Despite the app seemingly giving the option to customize alarms, nothing happens when I try to change them, no menu opens etc. My problem is that the alarms are blaring so loudly I cannot actually use them - not even talking about public spaces but even my neighbors can hear that eardrum piercing disgusting sound (and it gives me half a heart attack every single time). Is there any way to make it quieter? I cannot find any settings in my phone that would allow me to do this. Vibration would be fine. A mere soundless popup would be okay though not ideal. I wanna listen to music and audiobooks on my phone without risking becoming deaf because these greedy \*\*\*\*\*\* aren't willing to invest in this app knowing very well we are dependent on it.

Changing systems is not an option because I need the smallest, thinnest sensor possible due to my hobby and the G7 or whatever the next best is, won't do.

Also can people with iOS change alarms? Abbott's hotline keeps insisting they cannot and the sound is loud on purpose so you can't overhear it. I'm calling bs on this one, they just don't want to spend the money to make improvements despite having horrible reviews on all platforms.

Also if I cannot use the alarms because they're too loud just how am I hearing them any better then? :( Do they not understand that having diabetes doesn't automatically mean one is also hard of hearing?

Thank for reading this rant :/

&#x200B;

Edit: Added screenshot for clarity. Right where it says Alarmtone benutzerdefiniert (customizable) I think I should be able to make changes. But you can't actually tap/klick it, nothing happens.

I scan my sensor, it works, but then within 5 minutes if I were to reopen app it has the same message and isn’t displaying my BG. what this ends up leading to is me missing highs and lows because no alarms go off, which when I’m sleeping is especially irritating. 

I have my signal loss alarm off because it was going off every 2 minutes pretty much. 

I contacted Abbott and all they said was that they could replace the sensor, but it isn’t a sensor issue, as this is the second sensor it’s happened with.

Since 2021 I am getting continuous updates on my Garmin through the help of a patched app and xdrip. However, since a few days now it doesn't work anymore. Seemingly the patched Librelink doesn't have a Bluetooth connection with my sensor. NFC works normally. 

I'm running it on a pixel 6 with android 14. Anyone else having issues? I've tried many things but to no avail. Reinstalling apps, clearing cache, enabling all permissions, putting new sensor etc. Now contemplating downgrading my Android version... As it feels naked without automatic and regular updates. 

Anyone have any ideas to debug? Alarms within Librelink also state signal lost which implies, to me, Bluetooth issues.

Fixed it differently. Diabox initially did not work but had to do with versions. It foes not send to watch for some odd reason but now uploads to a nightscout server. Watch takes it from there which should be more robust going forward (rather than depending on apps).",,,,,

I would like to have the option that as long as the value remains below 3.9 mmol/l, I am warned again every 30 minutes. Even if I have acknowledged the alarm.

However, I've noticed that with the last three sensors, towards the end of their ""runtime,"" they become very imprecise. My app shows a blood sugar level of 59 mg/dL, while a traditional fingerstick measurement indicates a value of 105. How do you handle this? Do you use the sensors for the full 14 days, or do you replace them earlier, for example, on day 12?

In such cases, do you contact Abbott and at least inform them about the inaccurate measurements towards the end of the sensor's lifespan, or do you even request a replacement?",,,,,

Freestylelibre,30/01/2023,30/01/2023 17:49,Libre 3 -- any hacks to disable the Urgent Low Glucose Alarm on the app?,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I have been an (on and off) user of [Freestyle Libre 14-day](https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/products/freestyle-14-day.html) (this is the ""v2"") for the past few years.

Been quite happy with it. (clarification -- I am not a diabetic. I use the CGM to kinda give me some insights into my body's metabolism).

However, I recently switched to using the [Freestyle Libre 3](https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/products/freestyle-libre-3.html) sensor and the corresponding app.

I like the fact that I no longer have to tap the sensor with my smartphone anymore.

However, one BIG problem I find is THERE IS NO WAY to disable the ""Urgent Low Glucose Alarm"" (I am using a Pixel 5 with Android 13).

Since I am not a diabetic, and I am actually on a ketogenic diet, it is quite normal to have my blood sugar dip below 50 mg/dL when I am sleeping, and also sometimes during the day. And the damn alarm keeps going off, and wakes me (and my wife) up.

To get around this problem, I now have to set the phone to ""airplane mode"" when I am sleeping.

But I would like to ask the community here -- is there another hack or trick that I can use to disable this alarm without having to put my phone in airplane mode?

Thanks in advance!",,,,,

Now I finished eating about 30 minutes ago and it puts me at 3.7, that makes no sense. I just took my blood again and I'm at 7.5 and likely going up.
Is it normal? Is it because it's the first 24 hours? My readings have not been accurate since it started.

Wonder if anyone can help. My Libre 2 sensor have been working fine all this time, with some issues like loss of signal, but nothing that bothered me as much as what is happening now. Since past 5 days, I have gone through 4 sensors, where my phone cannot detect the sensor. Now before anyone suggests, I have done everything to check and cross check my phone functionality in regards to NFC. My phone NFC works fine when tested, so I installed the app on my daughters phone (who has the same make and model as mine), which detected the sensor and worked. I am totally baffled, so I decided to reset my phone to its original factory setting, hoping any app that is conflicting with Libre gets removed, of course in doing so, I have lost all data on my phone - (don't worry, all was backed up prior). Now, effectively with a fresh phone (like new) loving the speed, but when I installed the Libre App, same thing happened, so all that was to NO avail. Claimed all the sensors from customer service for free, and now they have sent a reader with it, which means, I have to now carry this machine with me everywhere, and my £1000 smart phone is totally useless for this APP. That is what is frustrating me, and I don't know, who to got to? Samsung or Libre, as individually they work, but they are not working together. I can see both providers blaming the other.

Freestylelibre,29/12/2023,29/12/2023 19:47,Brand New iPhone + Signal Loss Every 20 Mins,"Hi, I just switched from Android to my very 1st iPhone this week, and it’s not playing nice with my sensor. I started a new sensor with the new iPhone when I got it, and ever since, the sensor loses signal approximately every 20 mins, on the nose, 24/7. I had to turn the signal loss alarm off, and now every time I open the app to scan, it’s not connected. I’ve missed 2 low episodes so far, not knowing until I started feeling crappy and scanned. I don’t know how to see my os version, but I took the phone out of a brand new box 7 days ago, so I assume it’s the newest.

Is this a result of a new os not playing nice with a Libre app that hasn’t been updated by Abbott yet, or is this something I can potentially fix? My Android phone did the same thing once, and Abbott had to update their app to fix it.

Also, is it my correct understanding that if I turn the volume down on a Snapchat or YouTube video for example, and forget to turn it back up, it’s also gonna lower the volume on my critical alerts? Is there a way around that? Seems like a safety failure to me to only have universal volume? 🤯

Thanks in advance, I’m new to iPhone and don’t quite know how this all works yet. 🤷🏼‍♀️",,,,,

Freestylelibre,30/12/2023,30/12/2023 07:55,Can I post my Freestyle Libres to another country?,"Hi there, I'm TY1 D and going traveling for three years from 2025. I currently use the Freestyle Libre 2. I'm thinking of taking all my sensors for the first year of traveling with me. Or maybe half and fly back to restock after six months. We'll only be in Europe so its not too far (I live in the UK). The second year is backpacking Asia. Again, the plan is to take all my sensors with me and leave half with a family member who live out there and fly back from where ever we are to restock as its quite a lot to carry all of it in my backpack. The last year is seeing some friends and working in New Zealand which is where im unsure of how it will all work. By this time I wont be able to restock my libres as easily as im now on the other side of the world and flying back home will cost thousands. Does anyone know if I can get someone to post my libres from the UK to NZ and whether they'll be allowed in the country/ through customs? I suppose the next best thing would be to buy them out there, but they are incredibly expensive and won't be compatible with my UK reader. Its a crazy plan but I know there is a way to do this somehow. Any advice would be seriously appreciated :).",,,,,

Should I be entering the calibrations on the G6 app instead of on the pump?

Also, these are not the only calibrations I’ve done. Initially I tried calibrating only once and then waiting several hours before doing so again. Here I was trying to force it. Neither helped.

Hello everyone,

I'm quite new to the whole diabetes thing (m 20), got diagnosed 3 weeks ago and have now decided on the freestyle libre 3 sensor as it's the only option for me cause my phone doesn't support the apps for dexcom and the others, so I need one with a reader but
now I'm starting to overthink and question if I set my hopes too high in the sensor as I started reading in forums/reddit and all I see are negative reviews - I'm actually a bit scared that it won't work as I expect it to be as I'm still in school and my hopes were up that I don't have to bloody measure (haha) as much as I do now when I'm back in school and that spikes my anxiety so much, I know if I'll get dissapointed I literally don't know how to cope at this point cause this whole thing is taking a huge toll on my mental health already (it's yet another thing besides many other health issues I already faced till now) so could anyone please give me some positive reviews on it if there are any, everything I read is that they fail over and over or give painfully false readings:')

It already sucks that I have to wait yet another 4 weeks till the next appointment to see if it got approved by insurance and I'm stressing the hell out but as I said I don't have any other options anyways

Edit: Thanks a lot for the answers, got a letter by my insurance yesterday, it didn't get approved even though the hospital promised me it will, because I don't have documentation of nightly hypos, which I don't find a reasonable thing cause how would I know except for the headache and the sweat in the morning:') I measure before going to bed so it doesn't happen anyways - I'm devastated and dissapointed",,,,,

Was the G7 an improvement? I ask bc my 6 year old (dXed 10/22) has had his since January but he fights it *so much*. He walks around bent sideways for at least an hour after “installation”, and I think he has only managed to keep it in for the entire ten days twice. He usually rips it out in his sleep (so I can’t even say he’s being defiant).
We’ve tried putting it in different places but he’s very thin so his belly and thigh are really the only spots where there’s enough meat for it. Weirdly, he has absolutely zero problem with finger sticks.
I’m obviously not willing to put him on an insulin pump yet since he can’t even keep his CGM in full time, but I know his endo is going to fuss at me about that next week. His numbers aren’t great; I REALLY NEED to figure out a way to make this more comfortable for him so we can manage his diabetes better. Orrrrrr is he being a 6 yo boy, tugging on Mom’s heartstrings bc he can tell I feel terrible for him?

I recently upgraded to the G7 and it's been the opposite experience with huge random gaps, numbers sometimes reporting as super high or low without fingersticks matching, and dying after 6-7 days.

diabetes_t1,22/07/2023,22/07/2023 20:48,Medtronic should be embarrassed by Dexcom,"TLDR: The Dexcom sensors are so much better than the medtronic sensors and it should be a wakeup call to them.
Just a little backstory: I was diagnosed in 2014, and got a pump soon after that. My first pump was the last one Animas made and was compatible with the Dexcom (G4? I think?) sensors. I loved that pump, and loved how accurate the sensors were. 2 years later, Medtronic acquired Animas and discontinued the pump, and I was forced to switch to the Medtronic pump with their CGM system for 3 years. Recently, I have switched to the Omnipod system using the Dexcom G6 as my sensor, and I wanted to jump in here to compare them.
The Dexcom system is fantastic, better in every way than the medtronic system. The medtronic system actually made my control worse. The main issues I encountered with the medtronic system were:
1. The medtronic CGM adhesive was garbage — I would regularly have sensors fall off after a couple days. Dexcom can still be properly stuck on there for weeks!
* The medtronic accuracy was awful — consistently 1 or 2 mmol/L (18-36 mg/dl) off, and would get worse through the life of the sensor. Dexcom is consistently bang on accurate after over a week.
* The Medtronic CGM needs recalibrating constantly. At the very least every 12 hours, which is super annoying if you calibrated in the middle of the day, forget to recalibrate before you go to bed, and it wakes you up. Dexcom? No calibration necessary, it's amazing.
* This is specific for me, but Dexcom sensors are covered by my health care and the medtronic ones where costing me an arm and a leg.
The result of all of this was that my control was significantly affected when I was on the medtronic pump. Sensors falling off would often leave me for long periods where I had no sensor and fell back to fingersticks. The poor accuracy meant I was hesitant to trust the reading from the CGM to make adjustments, or worse take the wrong dose dependant on the bad data. The random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and my partner's sleep and effected our relationship. All in all, it was a serious step backwards from where I was. I just wanted to put this out there as a bit of first hand experience with the two systems. When I was moving to this system, I talked to the Medtronic pump rep and voiced these concerns when he was trying to sell me on their new system. What I gathered was that their closed loop system uses the same CGM with the terrible adhesive, same calibration requirements, and same terrible accuracy as the old one. If I can recommend anything, it would be trying to get looping using Dexcom sensors and Omnipods running off your phone. It's liberating.
Best of luck team, hope the roller coaster's not too extreme for you guys today 🤪
Edit: I was on the 630G pump and the Guardian 3 sensor. Apparently the new one is a pretty good upgrade compared to the older one. That being said, I was also looking at [this](https://www.pumpsandpricks.com/post/medtronic-guardian-4-sensor-review) article that echoed some of my same points above... I dono, it looks the same and seems to have the same problems.

I'm really considering switching to Tandem/Dexcom because I'm tired of dealing with low quality pumps that fall apart! Additionally, seeing others talk here and after taking with my endo, I think Tandem and Dexcom sound like a better quality devices. 

If/when I talk to a Tandem rep, I'm going to get all the details about why their pump and sensors are great. So I would like to hear from users about things you DON'T like. Not because I want to be talked out of changing, but because I want to go into this with realistic expectations and know what I'm dealing with. 

I also was wondering about whether charging the pump is pain? In theory I'm all for rechargeable batteries, but the idea of being tied to an outlet is... unappealing. At least with my Medtronic pump, I know I'm never far away from somewhere I can buy a AA battery or someone who can give me one. How do you deal with charging?

Does anyone have advice about improving his success rate? He follows all setup instructions, but calibrations fail. They fail so often that he doesn't think it's worth it anymore. Calls to Medtronic offer no real solutions. The setup takes so long, he doesn't want to deal with it taking up hours of his day. He has used Medtronic pumps since diagnosis in 2016 but has never gotten the hang of the CGMs.

Does anyone have tips or other advice they use to get theirs to work? Best time of day to start one? Best BS number to be at to start one? Start with active insulin or without? Best placement on the body? Any advice is appreciated.

He is looking into T-Slim and Dexcom but that can't happen until next year. My fear is that they don't really work any better.

He wants to move into his own apartment by himself and I really want him to have this system working for him, so I have some peace of mine.

I haven’t ate anything since 4 hours ago and my level are constantly rising sometimes they’ll drop but then go back up 10 points.

Tonight my sugar did go low so I treated it, got up to 156 via my BG and my sensor is still saying I am below 50. I've tried everything. Walking it back up via calibration by saying my sugar was 88 and then I was going to bring it back to full accuracy with more calibrations. No go. Obviously just putting in 156 won't work. Even worse I just started this sensor before I went to bed.

So now here I am 45 minutes in to treating my low. It's 3:11 in the morning. I am tired and just want to sleep. This shouldn't be an issue like this. Why even have us calibrate the stupid things if it doesn't believe us?! I'm only using the G3 sensors because the medical distributor I got saddled with, thanks insurance, can not or will not receive my prescription for the G4 sensors to go with my 780 insulin pump.

diabetes_t1,20/10/2023,20/10/2023 18:03,Consistently very inaccurate CGM readings at higher blood sugar levels,"I've been using CGMs for a few years now and I've noticed over the years that if my blood sugar is over 8 mmol/l or 140 mg/dl then the readings get significantly higher than what the finger pricks show. This hasn't just been occasional faulty sensors but I've observed this same behavior in most if not all sensor I've used over 3 years. For example right now my sensor is showing 240mg/dl while from the finger it was 180mg/dl and it wasn't changing, it had been flatlining for 2 hours. Last sensor I had an instance where it was showing 350mg/dl on the sensor but was 240 mg/dl from finger.

Another annoying thing related to this is the sensor tends to correct itself to an accurate reading at around 140 mg/dl which shows as an instant drop by like 40mg/dl. This then triggers it to start predicting a low and triggering alarms since it dropped so quickly.

I know the margin of error is supposed to be max 20% but if I acted on that then I could've returned over half of my sensors by now. At this point I know this happens and when I see some number like 220mg/dl I think okay it's probably like 180 realistically, but it does skew all the time in range, GMI, etc estimations quite a bit and I have to explain to my endo every time that it shows significantly higher numbers the higher it goes.

I've been hearing from a lot of diabetics, and also from my endo that most diabetics use CGMs mainly and don't even prick their fingers anymore, however if I trusted the sensor and gave doses based on what it said then I would be going low very often. I have no problem with measuring from the finger but the problem is that in my country they have started restricting the amount of test strips they give and just tell you to look at your sensor. I still measure from finger before every meal because I just don't trust it. I still feel the CGM is very useful in looking at how the blood sugar curve generally looks after different foods and it tends to be quite accurate at the 80-120mg/dl range so it does help with low alarms which I find to be a necessity at this point.

Has anyone else experienced consistently very inaccurate readings at higher levels?",,,,,
diabetes_t1,10/11/2023,10/11/2023 02:40,Am I weird for not wanting a CGM?,"So this is a bit of a rant but I also would like input from anyone else who feels the same. I've had T1D for 11 years, I'm 21 now and just had my first appointment with a new adult care endocrinologist. I've been on syringe and vial with no CGM the entire time. At this new appointment, the endo was very pushy and judgemental over me not wanting to switch to a CGM or insulin pens. She also poked fun at the fact that my heart rate was up (doctors in general give me anxiety, not to mention a whole new doctor). I explained to her that while yes a CGM would definitely help my numbers and A1C (it's not the best currently) I just don't want a device attached to me. I didn't mention this at the appointment but I feel like it would give me sensory issues and I'd just want to rip it off my arm anyways. She kept trying to push insulin pens too, judging the way I carry my vials by saying it's a lot to carry (it's not and I'm used to it, also pens are bigger than vials so that doesn't make any sense). I am more open to trying a CGM than insulin pens, but I don't want to feel forced into it. She set up an appointment for me with a diabetes educator to educate me on CGMS and put through a prescription for a CGM. This all feels forced and like I was bullied into it. 
Does anyone else have a similar experience with an endo? or does anyone else not want a CGM? This endo made it seem like I'm insane for not wanting one and like I'm the only patient she has without one. I'd like to know I'm not alone here lmao.",,,,,

My one concern, though, is that the app is just terrible! Are there alternatives people have been using?

Things I wish I could do in the app:

* Basic navigation of the data. Why can't I scroll back in time and zoom with standards gestures? This is REALLY what would be the bare minimum that's acceptable.

* Ability to add notes in the past (without having to manually go through logbook - just display the clock any time we add a note).

* Notes that don't duplicate. If I add a log entry where I select ""snack"" and write down what the snack actually was, it logs two records for some reason. Comments should just be an attribute of the one record.

So, assuming this isn't getting fixed soon, I see two paths forward:

1) Download the historical data manually (or via API if available) and load it into a time series viewer that doesn't suck (or build my own)

2) Find an app I can use instead of the default Abbott one.

What have people been using? Ideally it's something without subscription fees, and where I own my data.

Freestylelibre,1/10/24 22,01/10/2024 22:44,CGM vs Finger Prick Readings Differ?,"Hello! I randomly got a low sugar alert on my phone from my CGM (Libre 2) saying that my sugar had dropped to 3.7 mmol/L (66 mg/dl). However a minute later I was pricking my fingers about 3-4 times and got different readings that all were between 4.8 - 5.3 mmol/L (86 - 96 mg/dl)... All throughout this I was feeling completely normal. I'm not diabetic.

Which reading is more reliable? Should I be concerned about Libre 2 or not concerned based on the finger prick test?",,,,,

Freestylelibre,01/01/2024 17:00,01/01/2024 17:16,Frustrating experience,I started using libre freestyle 2 about 6 months ago. I paid $150 for the reader and $40 per sensor and have used 8 sensors. Three sensors outright failed. The other 5 sensors gave me BG readings that were off by more that 30 points. I have had the sensor report 175 when my finger blood said 124. I have had the sensor wake me up at night with low sugar alarms when my finger blood was 112. I consider my experience with the freestyle 2 to be a waste of $480 and a huge inconvenience in my quest to control my diabetes.,,,,,
Freestylelibre,01/01/2024 22:00,01/01/2024 22:29,Newbie here,Please be patient with me. I started using the libre 2 last night and I keep getting readings like 57 or 76. Using my finger stick it's showing double. Is this normal?,,,,,
Freestylelibre,01/07/2024 23:00,01/07/2024 23:48,Why is my libre 3 reading so low? Am I doing something wrong?,"It’s my first time trying a CGM. I put on the sensor yesterday on the back/side of my upper arm. It was secure, and for the first hour or two seemed to be reading fine. After a while, I kept getting low glucose alarms, to the point where I was woken up several times last night. I wasn’t laying on the side that my sensor is on. At one point it was reading my sugar as 54mg/dL when a finger prick showed my levels as 112mg/dL. After 24 hours of no improvement, I contacted Abbot and they’re going to send me a new sensor. So I took the old one off and put a new one on, making sure it’s on the back/flabby part of my arm and not towards the side like my old one, and the second sensor is doing the same thing so far. 🤦‍♀️

Any insight? The second sensor is reading the exact same range as the first. Averages around 65-80 with occasional dips into the 50s, and occasionally going into the 90s. It only went up to 108 after I ate dinner, while a finger prick showed 167 after dinner. 
Did I get two faulty sensors in a row? It’s just weird to me that they’re both showing the same numbers. Should I try a different spot? Wait longer for the sensor to stabilize? I almost want to give up after all of the bad things I’ve heard about Libre.",,,,,

I’m also getting a lot of low glucose readings. Just now 73 on Libre and 103 on a prick.

My dinner was balanced: tilapia, half cup rice, and broccoli. Water to drink. Two hours after eating my glucose was at the day high of 155, and two hour after that... 63.

But the graph does not show a measurement anywhere near that. It’s been about 24 hours since I put in this new sensor…will this get better?

diabetes_t2,07/12/2023,07/12/2023 16:34,"here's more than you ever wanted to know about GMI: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196826/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196826/)

The gist of it is in figure 1 - you can see from the scatterplot how a large ranges of different average glucose numbers actually map to the same lab measured A1C.

GMI more or less works the problem backwards by looking at a large database. For other people who have a glucose profile like you, what was their A1C when lab tested?

The results are a little different than the estimated glucose to A1C conversions we are used to. You'll see that a 125 gives you a 6.3 A1C instead of the 6.0 we are accustomed to. Again, this is based on the database of actual outcomes not the math of what should happen. The paper goes on to talk about what might be causing all the variations.

I tend to think that the average glucose number is more important than the GMI and even more important than the A1C because there are things that skew the latter two - and they skew them in different directions between patients in ways you cannot see.

One interesting finding is the ""skew"" tends to be consistent in the individual (but not between individuals). So if your GMI is always higher than your A1C then it will probably always be that way (and vice versa).

hth",Thank you! That is very informative and just the kind of answer I was hoping for!,,,,,
diabetes_t2,30/01/2023,30/01/2023 20:57,"The levels will always be different between different testing methods. You can take your blood sugar three different ways all at the same time...through your Libre, with a finger poke, and through a venous draw and none of the numbers will be the same. That is because they are all testing different fluids in the body. The Libre tests the glucose levels in the Interstitial Fluid under your skin. Finger pokes test capillary blood and venous draws test venous blood. They are all different fluids and therefore the numbers will never be the same. That is completely normal.

diabetes_t2,11/02/2023,11/02/2023 10:59,"You trust (and verify) both.

Finger sticks are checking glucose in your blood stream right now. Your CGM is testing the glucose in your interstitial tissues, which is usually 15 to 20 minutes behind a finger stick. 

So, if on your CGM you get a reading that is too high or low and worries you, do a finger stick and verify. Everything should be within the variances of devices (glucometer and CGM). It takes some time to get used to switching to a CGM.

As for your spikes, yes, it does make sense. Your body is an autonomous system. When it thinks it needs sugar, it will tell the liver to release sugar. If you're not eating enough and the body feels that it requires it, it will get it. The same goes for too much sugar. When it has enough, the rest goes to long term fat storage.

Your A1C and numbers seem excellent. Relax, take a deep breath, and try to understand that the two readings are not the same. Remember, finger sticks are the front of the train, CGM readings are the back of the train. Eventually, they will catch up (within the variance) with your glucometer.",,,,,,

I want to tell you to be kind to yourself; your grief is so heavy right now and that makes it even harder. Why not try with small changes? I would first eliminate a few foods that we know cause high blood sugar such as potatoes, pasta, bread. Just get rid of them. If you cook, fix some chicken breasts or thighs (bake is easy). Have fresh salad stuff on hand and make yourself an amazing salad for each supper... lots of things you love. Most fast food places and sandwich shops will fix yours in a bowl rather than on bread, I can vouch for how delicious Five Guys burgers in a bowl are (I love mine with grilled onions and mushrooms and cheese). Jimmy Johns will fix any sandwich in a bowl. Look for these small hacks to help you along and accept that you will do the best you can do and if you mess up well just try again.

1) Of course you need to set the alarm settings in your app. Make sure you also have set the right level. If I am correct, you only get one alarm each time you cross the boundary. For example, if you set the low glucose alarm to a certain value, you only get an alarm if it goes below that.

Freestylelibre,27/07/2023,27/07/2023 13:11,"Just have to say, the alarm at 55 mg/dl is RIDICULOUS. The physician brochure brags about it being called a ""mandatory 55 mg/dl alarm"". The loudness on a phone his levels that cause ear damage on a Pixel 5a phone and yet when you call support, they read a script acting like they've never heard of it. If you post a comment on their app review page in the Google Store, they respond with a canned response saying to call their support line, who then by every account I've heard from others, hears ""I haven't heard of this before!"" in the response from the agent. I'd be so much happier if the alarm wasn't making my ears ring and house wake up, or damaging my hearing when I have headphones in.
Regarding your sensor experience, you can apply the sensors to other parts of your body and see what happens. There is a TCOYD video on all the different places you can insert the sensor. The reason for the back of the forearm is this is where they chose to have FDA approval for testing, but I've seen folks put them on their belly, legs, and upper backs! It could be the sensors you have were all exposed to high heat (which would be unfortunate) during shipment.
Definitely call the support number and tell them you hate the alarm and indicate the issue and get a fresh replacement sensor from them (they usually ship them quickly). That'll you a sensor from a different lot.
I think I read that this sensor also uses ""predictive lows"" to alert you to a low, though it doesn't seem to be what you are struggling with. The predictive lows use a trajectory to give you knowledge of the impending low about 10-15 minutes before it happens (but it's not always right). In your case, it seems like the sensor is failing to sense glucose, which could mean the glucose oxidase was damaged by heat or freezing. Unlike a test strip, it's hard to ""test"" this fact. You might consider finding a new supplier for your sensors, too, just in case they have a habit of leaving them out on a shipping dock or hot/cold storage.

Freestylelibre,30/05/2023,30/05/2023 03:17,"The needle looks intimidating but looks can be deceiving - the needle you can see there is part of the grey applicator and not the sensor: it’s there to insert the tiny flexible filament (part of the sensor) and then retracts immediately and disposed of with the applicator. You are not left with the needle in your arm. 

First time took me a long time to do it too but once it was done I felt like laughing because it was literally nothing compared to my own dread. The sense of achievement is real too and you will feel like you accomplished something constructive and worthwhile once you start checking your blood sugar wirelessly. Your fingers also heal up nicely too and will be grateful for a break from finger pricking 😂","Great response, I did wonder about the needle, and you helped me understand the reality of what happens. Now I know why the pain is minimal, it makes total sense, so thank you for posting this! I have only successfully inserted one so far, and this puts me more at ease to continue inserting them. I also know what you mean about feeling like I've accomplished something constructive and worthwhile, I love this whole wireless thing and being able to keep a constant watch on my B.G.

So for Android or Apple, you want to make sure your OS is up to date as well as your freestyle libre app. 
1. It is also important on where you are applying your sensor. 
2. You also want to consider purchasing a protective patch such as Skin Grip.

https://skingrip.com/collections/all

3. If you received a supply of 2 sensors depending on your insurance, you are more than welcome to apply a new sensor. After that, you will want to contact Freestyle Libre customer service.

5. https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/support/contact-us.html
More than likely you will be connected with someone in the Philippines due to outsourcing. 
They will ask you a number of questions but you will basically want to share with them the problems you have experienced and request for a free replacement sensor. They will then ask you some questions like the version number of your os that you are currently using followed by you going into your freestyle libre app to provide some additional information. They will walk you through the steps. 

When your sensor fails or stops working, you can call customer service to request for a replacement. I have done this many times. Unfortunately, I have had many sensors bug out on me or just stop working. 

Just in case, I would hold onto the box and case of the sensor. The bottom flap of the box contains the serial and lot #. There were times when they asked to return the broken sensor in question and sometimes not. If they do ask to return, they will send you a box and envelopes to return the sensor in question. (Free shipping label).

Best of Luck. If you are paying all that $$$ for the sensor and it is breaking on you, you have every right to request a replacement sensor.",,Thanks so much !,Correct…it’s designed to insert the filament into your arm…it doesn’t go all the way into skin…LOL,,,

1. Created a fresh new Google account using a VPN (configured to the original country that I purchased the sensor from, in my case Portugal). Just so you know, you probably will need a phone to validate the account (the phone number can be from any country).
2. I added this account to my Android phone in the Play Store application (I just added another account without replacing the previous one). 3. Then on my desktop PC, I entered Incognito and went to the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/games), searched for the LibreLink application while logged in to my foreign account and then clicked install and chose my device. 4. That's it, and now you have the official app of the country that you need, and everything works!",The same applies for apple ids use the same email you created to make an apple Id for Portugal.

Freestylelibre,22/05/2023,22/05/2023 12:36,"As it stands, you can only mirror notifications to your smartwatch from the freestyle libre app to watch.

If you use android you can get a 3rd party app for both phone and watch called Juggluco. You can get it from the developers' website as it's not available on playstore. You will need to side load the app but it's not hard, and all instructions are on the site if you've never done sideloading before.

http://www.juggluco.nl

I have been using it with the FSL2 sensor for a while now. It turns my 2 into a 3, basically giving me a CGM. I use it with my samsung smartwatch 5 it works great with the FSL2. I've heard it works much better with the 3 but never tested it as I can't get one in the UK.

The instructions can be a bit confusing, but read it all first then go for it, and it makes more sense.

It has a ton of other benefits like device mirroring so you can have another device get the readings too via the Internet live. It links with libreview and sends all your readings from both sensor and scanned smartpens to your account. It can link multiple sensors at once, usefull when swapping sensors so no hour gap in readings. Easily export data straight from the app and more.",thank you for the info and ill try it sometime this week and ill let you know how it went down with the sideload and the \[libre 3 sensor. appreciated,,,,,

One update since I posted, then nothing for the last 15 minutes. I'll reboot everything on this end ... again.","Exactly the reason. It is the tissue reacts to having a needle and filament put into the skin and can take up to 24 hours. As its reading fluid from subtutanious tissue, it's not always accurate after first insertion due to the immune response from your body","Thank you and that’s a great idea.

I just got off the phone with Abbott and they gave me a voucher for a replacement. I’d like to get it today but the neighborhood pharmacy I use is closed and I doubt the big chains will accept it without a prescription.

Your supplier would have received a bunch from a bad batch and thats why you had a group of bad ones, They weren't to know. Abbott will replace them all for you for free with new ones from a good batch","I don't want to be a pain, but I do not believe Abbott recognized a 'bad' batch of sensors. I worked in the medical device industry for many years. If a manufacturing defect is uncovered in a specific batch, the manufacturer would be required (by the regulator, the FDA) to issue a formal recall of the defective product. This would be shown on the FDA web site, and the last Abbott recalls were the Similac thing and the FSL2 readers. The replacement of sensors is to comply with requirements for medical devices to meet their specifications. I personally believe that there are difficult quality issues with this device. I have experienced a 20% failure rate. I'm sincerely thankful I don't have to try to solve that one!","Another benefit is that juggluco can broadcast the value to other apps, so you can use g watch wear instead for the watch too.

Freestylelibre,22/05/2023,22/05/2023 04:20,"The idea is that for the first 12-24 hours, the skin and surrounding tissue are reacting to the trauma and injury imposed by the needle that inserted the filament. The reaction is believed to potentially cause inaccuracies during that time.
Applying the sensor 12-24 hours prior to activating it would, then, give the skin and tissue time to react and then return to some semblance of normal and give you the chance to bypass that 12-24 hours of possibly inaccurate readings and begin with readings that should be more accurate.","Thank you for explaining! That makes sense! But it leaves me a bit confused about the whole 14 day thing. If I put in a sensor 24 hours before I activate it, what happens at the end of the 14 days? Won't my readings on day 14 & 15 be off?

At least they always replace them when they fail!","Regarding the patches…I’ve been using fully covering patches since I started using patches…my main reasons for using patches are:

- to protect the sensor and prevent it from coming off if I knock my arm against something (like a door frame)
- additional water resistance. I have a swimming pool and In line to spend more than 30 minutes in it.

My phone is most of the time showing three lines (""no recent data""). On the son's phone readings have been constantly visible except one time there was sensor error (not sure how it is translated in English) which took 3-5 minutes.

What we have also past few days noticed that Libre3 was the other night giving (1-2 times per hour) notification of ""now you can follow your glucose readings in app"".

> . . . my glucose spiked to ~183. Is this a “normal” response to a big influx of sugar or indicative of an issue?
No. ""Normal"" people almost never go over 140.
> I also took Zoloft at ~12:45. Could that have caused the 5am spike too?
When the liver is busy processing alcohol your blood sugar will be a bit lower. Once it is done with the alcohol your blood sugar will rise.
> In that vein, how much and how long of an impact will alcohol have on my numbers? A few hours? Or into the next day?
An adult male's liver can get through about one ""standard drink"" per hour; a woman is a bit lower. Your glucose levels will be lower while processing alcohol, and then will climb. This should mean a couple of hours; if you are drinking more than 2 standard drinks a day the damage from the alcohol will exceed the benefit of the temporarily lowered glucose. In that case, a visit to /r/stopdrinking could be very beneficial.
>When we talk about numbers “after eating” are we talking about “after you start eating” or “after you finish eating”?
Officially it is 1h after the first bite, because the first bite is when your body starts processing the food and raising your blood sugar level. But as you have discovered, it's not exact. A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) is incredibly valuable to learn how different foods affect you.
> Am I right in thinking that stress will play a role here?
Absolutely! The good news is that the damage from diabetes is something that accumulates over multiple decades. So if you're high than ideal for a week, or a month, or even a full year . . . you will be OK. You should take this seriously, but you shouldn't stress out about it.","Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response. This community has been so kind and helpful so far and I’ve joined the prediabetes sub as well. I have a lot to learn!

I occurs to me now that the 183 I got after cocktails was within the first day of wearing the sensor, where it also gave me a 69 earlier that day. I haven’t seen numbers that high or low since so maybe it was Libre still calibrating. For comparison, I had two negroni sours last night and only peaked to ~155. Point taken that these are still high numbers though. It’s also worth noting that the past two days have had back to back social commitments and aren’t my typical drinking schedule. I’m more typically a “two glasses of wine with dinner maybe twice a week” drinker.

I’m also hoping that as I get more comfortable wearing the Libre and, as a result, spend less time staring at the app watching the numbers change, I might see my numbers mellow out just a bit. This has definitely been a huge education on the role of stress on the body, where previously I think I always regarded my anxiety as “not bad enough” to impact my body. I’m in my early thirties and am just now starting to come to grips with the fact that I can’t just white-knuckle my body through life and hope it holds up. It’s been terrifying, but so important.","Hey,

Like the other poster says, it's nice if it makes the disease easier, but some of the deals just cause us to spend more money to make our lives better.

Here, if you have to bolus, the NHS covers the sensors, so it will likely be covered for us as well. The great thing about socialised medicine is that they have an incentive to help people be as healthy as possible!

When I first started using the sensors, I had to pay out of pocket. I didn't have to pay VAT, but they were close to 50 quid each.

I'm American and so glad I don't have to fight with insurance for the sensors and the insulin!

We don't pay for prescriptions in Wales. In England, if you're diabetic, you get associated meds at a deeply discounted price. I don't think my MIL pays more than £10 for any of her meds, though.

On other phones you can actually change the alarm settings btw. It's really just the crappy app and the fact that they don't feel like making it work in all phones because that would cost money.

I used to be in the 8+ rang e whereas I've been averaging 6.5 the last 18 months.
FWIW to anyone experiencing issues: I was frustrated with the G6 the first few times but after complaining on this forum I came to realize I didn't understand some of the basics. For example, the timing differences between the G6 and BG monitor due to intersitial vs blood samples, respectively. I also calibrated too much and also tried to make it match the BG numbers shortly after eating a meal which was a big mistake on my part. Right before I switched to the G7 I started putting the sensors on the back of my arms and I noticed much more accurate readings when compare to my BG tester.

They cannot help you. Not at all. SMH. Then to prep the area, I shave it using 91% isopropyl alcohol. No shave cream. I shave it in all directions.

diabetes,31/10/2023,31/10/2023 01:55,"I've had approximately 6 90day eversense implants. It's accurate. However I believe it still requires daily calibrations which can be annoying. Granted there were times where I would just put in the exact number that the eversense app told me I was and say that's what the calibration was because I couldn't prick my finger at the time. They've since gotten approval for the 180 day sensor and maybe daily calibration requirements have changed. I like the simplicity of putting on new dexcom sensor at home in addition to it being able to loop with omnipod 5 or tandem insulin pumps. I'm not sure if eversense has any pump integrations. Years ago when I used it there was an app bug that enabled you to use the same sensor past the 90-day expiration. I pushed the limit to around 6 months or so or even longer. What I noticed overtime after extending the sensor was that accuracy at high glucose levels wasn't good but it still maintained accuracy at normal and low levels. An example of this would be my finger stick would say I was 250 but eversense said I was 190. From what I heard the 180 day sensor didn't change from the 90-day sensor, so I would be kind of skeptical of it being accurate at highs for the whole 180 days. If you do decide to try it, the insertion isn't bad. They use lidocaine to numb you and make a small incision to implant the device. I would absolutely use eversense if I was a water athlete or something similar. As for your dexcom falling off, shave your skin and clean it with rubbing alcohol and apply skin-tac before putting the dexcom on. Doing so should ensure that it doesn't fall off for a long time.

I'm on the Dexcom One at the moment which is my current prescription.

If I could choose, then I would go for the G7, but only because the app offers the at-a-glance feature on my phone's lock screen. The Dexcom One app doesn't have this so I have to unlock my phone and open the Dexcom app to see my BG.

The Dexcom Once doesn't have an app that runs on my Pixel watch either.

In terms of application, comfort and accuracy I have not noticed any difference. The G7 is smaller with a lower profile than the One which is the same size and shape as the G6. 

Being able to calibrate the Dexcoms against a finger prick seems to make it more accurate than the Libre2. That is if it needs calibrating, and after it's been calibrated. Dexcoms are a complete pain if you get a sensor that needs calibrating.

I have never personally had issues with the adhesive.

Outright pain is rare but it's possible if it ends up hitting a muscle (in my case). Which unfortunately seems like it'd be more likely in a 6-year old. There's just less *everything* in that case. A G7 might help somewhat in that case...?

Schedules in school are wild and can and will change without much communication to parents. Extra recess bc its beautiful out, double up on PE bc the art teacher is out sick, not to mention recess is typically after lunch (and thus activates the kids insulin extra hard.). At 5- your child may or may not be able to communicate his schedule to you and why he dropped- but also hypoglycemia can come on FAST. The nurse might mean well and think she’s comfortable- but in my experience with my kid- the school system has only ever had superficial knowledge of Type 1. Also- schools have SOOO much extra food for all sorts of nonsense reasons and its nice to be able to have the kid (or teacher) shoot a text asking if its ok to eat xyz today and see the glucose and trend and ok (or deny) so they arent always left out (or having to delay and go to office etc). The pump decision can take or leave when (or if) your kid and you decide he’s ready….its really independent of the CGM.

I’ve tried Type 1 Tactical/EMD cases that everyone seems to love, and I found them to be too bulky for me personally. I wish someone would make a spring clip I can use to put it on my pocket, like we did with pagers back in the days before cell phones. I ended up with an $8 clip from Amazon slapped to the back of my pump, which works best for me. 2. There’s no brightness setting. It’s perfectly fine during the day, but when I wake up in the middle of the night and check it, I’d rather have an option to not burn my retinas out. 3. Charging. I personally find it annoying. I plug it in during a meeting at work or while I’m showering or while I’m on the couch watching TV, but I think I’d rather be able to replace a battery. That being said, I’m also reasonably sure if I had to replace the battery, I’d be complaining about the cost of batteries…so I don’t think there’s a good way to go about this. What I like about the Omnipod 5 is I can charge it overnight like my phone, but the tubing on the Tslim sort of makes that a really bad idea. One thing I want to add (and it’s a pro…sorry I can’t follow directions) that your Tandem rep probably won’t say is that Tandem customer service is UNBELIEVABLE. Every time I’ve called, it’s been a great experience…and this is from someone who DESPISES having to make phone calls. They’ve replaced infusion sets for anything and everything. They’ve replaced cartridges. They will overnight a replacement pump, should yours break. I once had insulin go bad, and I ran through a bunch of supplies before I figured it out. I called Tandem, SURE they wouldn’t replace three full site changes, and the first thing the rep asked was “are you ok?” I was panicked because I had literally wasted 9 days worth of sites, and I was rambling about that and crying, and she said “I’ll replace whatever you wasted. Are YOU ok, though?” I calmed down and assured her I was because I had used a syringe and injected from a fresh batch. Then she put in a replacement order for supplies, which showed up later that week. That experience made me feel like *I*, as a person, was important to Tandem, not just my money. They stand behind their products, and the people that staff those lines are either T1s themselves or related to a T1 (from what I’ve experienced). That level of support is so uncommon these days.","I do want to add to this: I’ve had a few times where getting ahold of tandem was difficult. But they did deal with the issue and work with me when I eventually got ahold of them. I will also say that no one else I know has had issues with getting ahold of tandem. I’m just unlucky.

But, a pump and cgm are statistically superior. And OP’s question kind of hints at that: how do people manage _well_ without them? And the answer is, statistically, they don’t. Not as well, anyway. That’s isn’t to say you can’t! Just that, on average, most people do much better with the tech.

Diagnosed in the 80's and never got good advise. My first doctor had a porn mustache and really creeped me out. Not a good excuse, but if you'd seen him, you'd understand.
The next specialist I was referred to basically said get a pump or find another doctor. This was in the 90's and there was no discussion, just an ultimatum. Guy was a total ass and have since found that he's the big cheese in Anchorage and is not someone (even other doctors) want to deal with. So no pump. Right now, I'm doing one stick in the morning and winging it the rest of the day. The newer insulin regimen has helped my A1C, but I'm far from perfect. I think my last one was 8.5.
I've found that I absolutely need a CGM and we're looking at what's out there.

Freestylelibre,01/07/2024 23:00,01/07/2024 23:48,"Personally, I soak my sensors when switching. I'm T2D, and this gives me the most accurate results. Soaking is when you place a new sensor 18-24 hours before the expiration of your current one, but DO NOT ACTIVATE IT. Placing a new sensor causes trauma (however minor) at the site that will cause a healing reaction. Placing a new sensor 18-24 hours ahead allows this trauma to subside and, as a result, get more accurate readings. The readings are a prediction of your glucose 10-20 minutes in the future. If your arrows are ⬆️↗️↘️⬇️, a finger stick will not be close. If it is ➡️, for like a half hour, it can be very close to a finger stick. And I've had a half dozen or so over a year that we're exactly the same as my finger stick.","I ""soak"" mine as well. Just like you, I noticed that if I activated a sensor immediately after sticking it on, I'd have wildly inaccurate readings for the first few days (and with those lovely 3 a.m. low sugar alerts).

Freestylelibre,01/09/2024 05:02,01/09/2024 05:22,"Finger prick blood glucose readings and sensor glucose reading won't always match and in fact are likely to be different.

Freestyle Libre and Dexcom G6 are factory-calibrated to estimate blood glucose based on interstitial glucose - which is the fluid between skin cells.

Vegetable can often counter carbs.

I don't use an alcohol prep to cleanse the area-I soak a 4x4 gauze pad with alcohol and clean the area thoroughly. Wait fot the alcohol to dry completely before applying. Turn off all alarms except fot the urgent alarm that you are unable to turn off. Once applied, place a tegaderm transparent dressing over the sensor. This will protect it and more importantly keep it in place. I find that small movement of the sensor needle can throw off readings. These dressings can be found on Ebay for great discount. Avoid vitamin C in doses over 250 mg. 

Finally, if you get a few non-proprietary apps, you can actually push your glucose numbers to your Apple watch which is hugely convenient not to mention cool. All above from my personal experience.

Any result you get from a scan will show you what it predicts your level is based on what it was 15 minutes ago and the lead up to that point. Once another 15 minutes elapses, the graph shows what the sensor actually recorded. Its why Abbott says not to treat based solely on what the sensors report as it is based on a prediction. If you're ever unsure of whether a sensor is accurate, always do a fingerstick test","Sensors can always be a little out in the first 24 hours. Some people ""presoak"" them by applying them 24 hours early but not activating them until the old one runs out.
