sensors are much better than the medtronic sensors and should wakeup call them just little backstory was diagnosed and got pump soon after that first pump was the last one animas made and was compatible with the dexcom think sensors loved that pump and loved how accurate the sensors were years later medtronic acquired animas and discontinued the pump and was forced switch the medtronic pump with their cgm system for years recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system actually made control worse the main issues encountered with the medtronic system were the medtronic cgm adhesive was garbage would regularly have sensors fall off after couple days dexcom can still properly stuck there for weeks the medtronic accuracy was awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the medtronic cgm needs recalibrating constantly the very least every hours which super annoying you calibrated the middle the day forget recalibrate before you bed and wakes you dexcom calibration necessary its amazing this specific for but dexcom sensors are covered health care and the medtronic ones where costing arm and leg the result all this was that control was significantly affected when was the medtronic pump sensors falling off would often leave for long periods where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant was hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustments worse take the wrong dose dependant the bad data the random nighttime recalibrations effected both mine and partners sleep and effected our relationship all all was serious step backwards from where was just wanted put this out there bit first hand experience with the two systems when was moving this system talked the medtronic pump rep and voiced these concerns when was trying sell their new system what gathered was that their closed loop system uses the same cgm with the terrible adhesive same calibration requirements and same terrible accuracy the old one can recommend anything would trying get looping using dexcom sensors and omnipods running off your phone its liberating best luck team hope the roller coasters not too extreme for you guys

sensor showing mgdl while from the finger was mgdl and wasnt changing had been flatlining for hours last sensor had instance where was showing mgdl the sensor but was mgdl from finger another annoying thing related this the sensor tends correct itself accurate reading around mgdl which shows instant drop like mgdl this then triggers start predicting low and triggering alarms since dropped quickly

from endo that most diabetics use cgms mainly and dont even prick their fingers anymore however trusted the sensor and gave doses based what said then would going low very often have problem with measuring from the finger but the problem that country they have started restricting the amount test strips they give and just tell you look your sensor still measure from finger before every meal

year ago aside from the known issues with the has anyone else noticed the readings are usually off still using meter confirm but been feeling really sick again for the first time months tired everyone praising having meter because you don have prick your finger much but still when haven been feeling well can keep sugars prior having dexcom some days would checking day know body the hypo side average glucose level but most the time the thought the was going help wouldn have lose much sleep the night but still checking frequently because always off\",\"looking for thoughts those who have used both the dexcom and the freestyle libre sick and tired lost signals and erratic readings dexcom well somewhat over half sensors last the entire day cycle people would limit discussion troubles praise for one device the other love hear from those with firsthand experience having used both systems hoping hear only from people have switched from with system the other please thank you\",\"they all have that same flaw and chance for that happen one better more recommended remember that they read interstitial fluid not blood dehydrated they inaccurate leaning the sensor too firmly inaccurate there are few studies that have shown that hydration status outside extremes has virtually impact cgm accuracy this more less old wives tale that dexcomlibre users have perpetuated the volume interstitial fluid fairly tightly controlled the body love that people downvote but can dispute lol\",\"dexcom libre hasn been week yet but already loving dexcom libre used the libre the beginning the year and had one sensor fall off few days one that lost connection and crapped out and one that kept giving lows night all night long got the libre prescribed couple weeks ago and had the from till the morning and did not know how fix just ripped off upset because paid for sensors that don plan using after the libre and literally traumatized their alarm sounds told endo want try dexcom bought new apple watch last week cause heard the app compatible see your mbers picked dexcoms and insurance covered cost was mind blown have such life changing device for love that you can calibrate your readings adjust alarm settings and can see numbers apple watch all day readings have been fairly range finger pricks and they not just calibrate and all good happy with dexcom\",\"ive been unlucky enough use the dexcom one and the libre all using android phones the dexcom one the moment which current prescription could choose then would for the but only because the app offers the ataglance feature phones lock screen the dexcom one app doesnt have this have unlock phone and open the dexcom app see the dexcom once doesnt have app that runs pixel watch either terms application comfort and accuracy have not noticed any difference the smaller with lower profile than the one which the same size and shape the being able calibrate the dexcoms against finger prick seems make more accurate than the libre that needs calibrating and after its been calibrated dexcoms are complete pain you get sensor that needs calibrating have never personally had issues with the adhesive its always stayed and never caused irritation regardless which device use thanks used them when they first came out the calibration issues including for sensor are burnt into psyche pixel and using fitbit doubt will work the fitbit may try the dexcom one and get round buying pixel watch consider the then ill self funding and hope this will avoid having back insulin but have feeling that may forlorn hope been though airports with dexcom and pump never had problem walk through show them the pump and have hand swab this question comes once week and always the same you are fine through scanners with your dexcom\",\"the current one wearing was bleeder kept because was often told bleeds reads after about hours giving inaccurate readings which within the time limits for that had few times where disconnected from bluetooth but after that for about another day runs just well any other sensor ive had dont think its possible for reuse them like you can with the dexcom
